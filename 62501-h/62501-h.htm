  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">IN preparing this detailed description of the ruins of Great
    Zimbabwe—the first given to the world in modern times—the author has
    aimed at permitting the actual ruins themselves to relate their own
    story of their forgotten past unweighted by any consideration of the
    many traditions, romances, and theories which—especially during the
    last decade—have been woven concerning these monuments.</p>

  <p>The only apology offered for this apparently lengthy Preface is the
    mention of the fact that the operations at Great Zimbabwe were carried
    on for six months after the text of this volume had been sent to
    the publishers in England. The Preface, therefore, thus affords an
    opportunity of bringing down the results of these operations to a
    recent date.</p>

  <h3>RUINS’ AREA</h3>

  <p>The recent examination of the district surrounding the ruins now shows
    the Ruins’ Area to be far larger than either Mr. Theodore Bent (1891)
    or Sir John Willoughby (1892) supposed. Instead of the area being
    confined to 945 yds. by 840 yds., it is now known to be at least 2
    miles by 1¼ miles, and even this larger limit is by no means final,
    as traces of walls and of walls buried several feet under the veld
    have been discovered, not only in Zimbabwe Valley, but in the secluded
    valleys and gorges and on the hillsides which lie a mile and even two
    miles beyond the extended <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>area. Huge mounds, many hundred feet in
    circumference, with no traces of ruins, covered with large full-grown
    trees and with the remains on the surface of very old native huts, on
    being examined have been found to contain well-built ruins in which
    were unearthed small conical towers, gold ornaments, a few phalli, and
    in one instance a carved soapstone bird on a soapstone beam 4 ft. 8 in.
    high, which is more perfect and more ornate than any other soapstone
    bird on beam yet found at Zimbabwe. The examination of such spots and
    of all traces of walls which lie at the outer edge of the extended
    Ruins’ Area would, even with a large gang of labourers, occupy almost a
    lifetime.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bent spoke of Zimbabwe as a “city,” and recent discoveries show
    the employment of this title to be fully justified, for not only is
    the Ruins’ Area vastly extended, but the formerly conjectured area can
    now be shown by recent excavations to have been much more crowded with
    buildings than could possibly have been seen in 1891. For instance,
    2,300 ft. of passages have recently been discovered within the heart
    of the old Ruins’ Area buried some feet under the silted soil below
    the veld in spots where the siltation is rapid, the existence of which
    structures had been altogether unsuspected. In some instances the
    native paths, used by visitors inspecting the ruins, crossed these
    passages from 3 ft. to 5 ft. above the tops of the passage walls.
    The enormous quantity of débris, evidencing occupations in several
    periods, scattered over both the old and the extended area, is simply
    astonishing, and judging by the value of “finds” made during the recent
    work, it seems quite possible that further exploration would, in the
    intrinsic value of relics as relics, largely reimburse the expense
    of its continuance, while securing the opening up of fresh features
    of architecture and probably some definite clues as to the original
    builders of the numerous periods of occupation respectively; would
    bring an immense addition to scientific knowledge, while the more
    important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span> ruins themselves, having been cleared of silted and imported
    soils and wall débris, are now ripe for the further examination for
    relics.</p>

  <h3>BURIAL-PLACES OF THE OLD COLONISTS</h3>

  <p>The secluded valleys, and also the caves in hills, for a distance of
    six miles, and in some cases as far as ten miles, from Zimbabwe have
    been systematically searched in the hope of discovering the burial
    place of the old gold-seekers. The neighbourhood of Zimbabwe contains
    several extensive ranges of granite hills each enclosing many secluded
    and Sinbad-like valleys and gorges, where natives state white men had
    never previously entered. Such spots on the whole of the Beroma Hills
    to the east of Zimbabwe, the south end of the Livouri Range to the
    west, the Bentberg Range to the south, and several hills in the Nini
    district, as well as several parts in the Motelekwe Valley, have been
    systematically searched without avail, though there are in certain
    of these secluded places traces of walls and artificially placed
    upright stones and other signs of human presence which require some
    explanation. The siltation of soil from the steep hillsides of many
    of these most romantically situated valleys has been very extensive.
    These searches could only be carried on after veld fires had swept the
    district of the rank grass which here grows to a height of 12 ft. Mr.
    Bent and other writers have shown that the old Arabians religiously
    preserved their dead, burying them in secluded spots at some
    considerable distance from any place of occupation. The writer is not
    without hope that these burial-places may yet be found. The population
    of Zimbabwe at several different periods must have been immense, and,
    judging by the remains found near some of the oldest types of ruins
    in other parts of the country where the amount of gold ornaments
    buried with each corpse ranged from 1 oz. to 72 oz., the discovery
    of such places in the Zimbabwe district would yield important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span>
    results, especially as, for many reasons, Zimbabwe undoubtedly appears
    to have been the ancient metropolitan capital and the centre of
    gold-manufacturing industry of the original and later Arab gold miners,
    and the place so far has yielded the richest discoveries of gold in
    every form.</p>

  <p>The writer is now perfectly assured that no burial-places of the
    original builders will be found under the interior of the Elliptical
    Temple or within 30 yds. of the exterior. Holes have been sunk at
    regular intervals within the temple and immediately outside the walls,
    and boring-rods have been systematically employed, and the position
    and lie of the formation rock ascertained throughout, so that sections
    and levels have been made of the soil and rock under the temple.
    All the results gained from each hole and boring are recorded. But
    beyond discovering buried foundations at the higher level, only virgin
    soil, never before disturbed, was gone through. French and German
    archæologists who visited Zimbabwe during the operations confirmed what
    British scientists have affirmed, that no burials of people of Semitic
    stock would be found within or near to any building so frequently in
    use as the great temple must have been. The severe restrictions with
    regard to cleanliness and sanitation, especially as to the dead, are
    among the most notable features of the old Semitic nations.</p>

  <h3>ABSENCE OF INSCRIPTIONS</h3>

  <p>No ancient writing has been discovered, though close attention has been
    paid to all stones and pottery likely to bear it, and notwithstanding
    that the interiors of some of the more ancient portions of the ruins
    have been cleared down to the old floors where, if any existed,
    they might reasonably have been expected to be found. Post-Koranic
    lettering was found on highly glazed pottery, also on glass, but all
    such specimens are of a fragmentary character; but experts such as Mr.
    Wallace Budge, the Head Keeper of Egyptian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">xix</span> and Assyrian Antiquities
    at the British Museum, state that the glass and other “finds” of
    pottery are not older than the thirteenth or fourteenth century of this
    era. Other pottery thickly covered with dull-coloured glazes—mainly
    purples, greens, and browns—is thought to be somewhat older than that
    on which the lettering was found. Still, as such a very large portion
    of what may be considered as the more ancient of the ruins remains to
    be examined, it may yet be possible to unearth older specimens of Arab
    writing.</p>

  <h3>TWO PERIODS OF GOLD MANUFACTURE</h3>

  <p>Gold in a manufactured form is found on the lowest and original floors
    of the most ancient portions of the Zimbabwe ruins. In several ruins
    this was found as thickly strewn about the cement floors as nails
    in a carpenter’s shop. Gold ornaments discovered at this depth, in
    some instances from 3 ft. to 5 ft. below any known native floors,
    were always found in association with the oldest form of relics yet
    unearthed at Zimbabwe. Such gold articles are of most delicate make,
    and are doubtless of an antique character, and expert opinion recently
    obtained in England confirms this conclusion.</p>

  <p>But there are other gold articles which are ruder in design and make,
    and these by no means are entitled to claim such antiquity. In fact,
    expert opinion declines to recognise them as being in any sense
    ancient; for instance, beaten gold of irregular shape showing the
    rough hammer marks of some very crude instrument, and with holes round
    the edges of such plates very rudely cut—or rather torn—and placed
    in imperfect rows altogether in a haphazard style. This form of gold
    plates is identical in every detail with the copper sheathing with
    which it is always found associated. The same remarks apply equally to
    the gold beads also found with this class of plates which betoken crude
    workmanship, as well as to the iron instruments decorated with small
    gold knobs.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">xx</span></p>

  <p>With regard to the location of the later-period gold articles there is
    ample evidence that these are of very old native origin. Such ornaments
    are commonly met with on the floors of, or in close proximity to, the
    old native huts of the types of Nos. 2 and 3 (see <cite>Architecture</cite>, s.s.
    <cite>Native Huts found in Ruins</cite>, pp. 154, 155, <i>post</i>), and also in the
    cement huts with small radiating walls on levels several feet above any
    ancient floorings. In every instance such gold ornaments are found in
    association with articles of old native make—such as double iron gongs,
    copper sheathing, and copper assegai- and arrow-heads.</p>

  <div class="center mt5">ELLIPTICAL TEMPLE</div>

  <h3>NORTH ENTRANCE</h3>

  <p>In 1902 the floor of the North Entrance to the temple was exposed to
    a depth of 5 ft. below the surface, as shown in Mr. Bent’s book (p.
    106), while a flight of steps in perfect condition leading up to the
    entrance from the exterior was discovered at a depth of 9 ft. below the
    old surface. This entrance, showing a bold conception and admirable
    construction, is now considered as one of the principal show features
    at Zimbabwe. Further, it is the oldest form of entrance and steps as
    well as the finest of any yet discovered in Rhodesia. A quantity of
    gold was found on the floor and steps of this entrance, which were once
    covered with fine granite cement, also a few true phalli.</p>

  <h3>PARALLEL PASSAGE</h3>

  <p>This has been cleared throughout to a depth of at least 3 ft., and in
    one place 7 ft. Cement floors were exposed, and these were found to
    be divided into small catchment areas with a drain from each passing
    outwards through the main wall. Five additional drains were discovered
    in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">xxi</span> passage. Here were found eight ornate phalli, a portion of a
    gold bangle, some beaten gold and gold tacks of microscopic size, and
    fragments of carved soapstone beams.</p>

  <h3>SACRED ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>This was cleared out to a depth of 4 ft. throughout its whole area, and
    a few phalli of unmistakable form were found, and old granite cement
    floors and steps were uncovered. Explorers and relic hunters had worked
    in this enclosure, and had double trenched it from end to end.</p>

  <p>A remarkable discovery was made here of distinct traces of granite
    cement dadoes, 7 ft. high, round the interior faces of the walls of
    this enclosure. In some other enclosures the remains of dadoes can
    still be seen.</p>

  <p>The small conical tower in this enclosure has during the last ten years
    been seriously damaged by the large trunk of a tree pushing over the
    summit of the cone. Photographs of this small tower taken in 1891 show
    that it was then almost intact.</p>

  <h3>PLATFORM AREA</h3>

  <p>This open area, lying to the west and north of the Conical Tower and
    the Platform, corresponds to the open areas immediately in front of
    the altars in old Grecian temples. This was Mr. Bent’s opinion, and
    possibly it answered at Zimbabwe a similar purpose of accommodating the
    worshippers. The area, some 120 ft. by 60 ft., has been cleared out of
    large trees, and of about 6 ft. of soil throughout, and floors—both
    cement and clay—were disclosed, also a fine circular structure of
    excellent granite cement, and ascended by two steps. On and close to
    this structure were found fragments, mainly bases, of carved soapstone
    beams of slender appearance, also some phalli and gold. This platform
    lies slightly off the north line between the Conical Tower and the Main
    North Entrance.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">xxii</span></p>

  <p>Some of the walls surrounding this area on the west and north sides,
    once considered to be ancient, can now be seen to cross over very old
    native clay huts and native copper and iron-smelting furnaces. The
    soil contained some phalli, which had been converted by the natives
    into amulets, also some Arabian glass—thirteenth and fourteenth
    centuries—Venetian beads, gold wire-work, beaten gold, gold scorifiers
    of native pottery, iron pincers, and fragments of carved soapstone
    bowls with geometric designs.</p>

  <h3>ENCLOSURES 6, 7, AND 10</h3>

  <p>Gold-smelting operations must have, at some late period, been
    extensively carried on in these enclosures, for on removing from each
    enclosure all débris and fallen stones to a depth of from 4 ft. to 7
    ft., there were found burnishing stones of fine grain and still covered
    with gold, gold scorifiers with gold in the flux, cakes of gold, gold
    furnace slag, beaten gold, and gold dust.</p>

  <p>At a still lower depth in No. 6 Enclosure a quantity of granite
    clay crucibles, showing gold richly, were met with, and these are
    undoubtedly of older type than the native pottery scorifiers, also some
    ingot moulds of soapstone of the double claw-hammer or St. Andrew’s
    cross pattern.</p>

  <h3>CENTRAL AREA</h3>

  <p>This area is only partially excavated, it being covered with old
    native-built walls which cross over bone and ash débris, old native
    huts, an iron furnace, and rich black mould in which the vegetable
    matter was still undecayed. Experimental holes and boring-rods showed
    that some very old foundations ran below the soil upon which the later
    and poorer walls are built. However, a key has now been found which
    will enable further excavations to be made within this area without
    injury to the upper walls.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</span></p>

  <h3>SUMMIT OF MAIN EAST WALL</h3>

  <p>Along the summit of the east main wall, and only over the chevron
    pattern which faces east, have recently been discovered the traces of
    foundations of small circular towers, both on the inner and outer edges
    of the wall. These correspond in measurement and relative position to
    the small conical towers on the west wall of the Western Temple at
    the Acropolis Ruins, which is decorated with monoliths. Some of the
    best-known surveyors and practical builders in Rhodesia are prepared
    to certify as to the traces of these foundations. This is entirely a
    new discovery, as is also the fact that at one time the summit of the
    wall, only over the chevron pattern, bore beautifully rounded soapstone
    monoliths, the bases being found displaced under the ruck of loose
    blocks which runs along the centre of the summit of this part of the
    main wall. Some carved splinters of these monoliths were found at the
    bases of the wall. A collection of these “finds” has been sent to the
    Salisbury Museum.</p>

  <h3>PROBABLE AGES OF THE WALLS OF THE ELLIPTICAL TEMPLE</h3>

  <p>All the walls of the Elliptical Temple are not ancient; that is,
    not ancient in the sense applying to the suggested Sabæo-Arabian
    occupation of Rhodesia and also to that of the Solomonic gold period.
    The evidences pointing to this conclusion, and now for the first time
    available, are so obvious and general, and the ocular demonstration so
    positive, that one of the many popular myths concerning Great Zimbabwe
    must, even at the risk of committing a vandalism on cherished romantic
    theories and beliefs, go by the board. The writer prefers that the
    ruins should tell their own story, and this can now be read in the
    walls, in the débris heaps, and in the relics and their associated
    “finds” and locations.</p>

  <p>The oldest walls of the temple for which great antiquity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</span> may be
    claimed are—the main east wall from north to south, the Conical Tower,
    the Platform, portions of the inner wall of the Parallel Passage
    (reconstructions are present here), and some adjoining walls, and some
    buried walls and foundations, and possibly some other walls on the
    south side, concerning which some doubt exists, as also the west wall
    of the West Passage, a well-built structure which once was extended at
    either extremity. As to the question of obviously much later walls,
    this is involved in the following section of this preface.</p>

  <h3>WEST WALL CONTROVERSY</h3>

  <p>The writer is fully convinced that the original west wall of the temple
    once extended outwards further west, and that the present west wall
    extending towards the south is of much more recent construction and
    is built on a shorter curve, <em>also that most of the structures of the
    central and western portions of the building are also of much later
    construction</em>, and this for many substantial reasons, some of which are
    here briefly stated:—</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) The west wall is considered by all practical builders and
    architects to be far slighter, much inferior in construction, fuller
    of defects, and to contain to a greater extent ill-shaped stones than
    the main wall on the east side, while the foundations are at many
    points far more irregular, and the batter-back of the interior face
    of the west wall is less severe than is the case of the east side.
    Lengths of 25 ft. each of both walls have been examined and compared
    and photographed, and the number of defects of construction recorded.
    The number of false and “straight joints,” false and disappearing
    courses, and stones supported at their corners by granite chips, which
    the west wall contains, is roughly about forty odd to every one of
    such defects in the east wall, which is <em>the</em> architectural marvel for
    symmetry, grand proportion, true courses of most carefully selected and
    assorted blocks (some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxv">xxv</span> of which have been dressed with metal tools) of
    any other ancient architectural features at Zimbabwe. All this is an
    ocular demonstration, and is commented upon by the most casual visitor
    to these ruins. This, too, is very patent when seen from the summit of
    Zimbabwe Hill, the view looking down upon the temple revealing most
    obviously the different characters of the walls.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) In 1903 the writer cleared the soil away from the gap between the
    older and later walls, and found that they were widely different in
    construction; that the later and narrower wall approached the older and
    well-built and wider wall at an oblique angle; and that the end of the
    older wall is broken and not finished off as are other ends of ancient
    walls. In a trench made at a distance of twelve yards west of the gap,
    and on the curve the older wall, if continued, would have passed, a
    mass of buried masonry, which might have been a portion of the old
    wall, was disclosed.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) Dr. Hahn, the leading expert in South Africa in chemical
    metallurgy, analysed the soil underlying the foundation of the west
    wall, and pronounced it to be composed of disintegrated furnace slag
    and ashes containing gold and iron. The ground to the west of the west
    wall has always been the spot at which gold prospectors have washed the
    soil for gold, and here gold crucibles and scorifiers are to be found.
    This soil contains 73 per cent. of silica, and would make an excellent
    foundation for walls, and the west wall is built right along this bed
    of furnace slag, which is about 2 ft. in depth, many yards wide, and
    extends from north to south.</p>

  <p>(<i>d</i>) At a few feet from the exterior of the west wall, and <em>at a depth
    of four feet below the level of its foundation</em>, and extending as shown
    in trenches and cross-cuts for at least thirty yards from north to
    south, is a floor of granite cement laid on the formation rock, hiding
    its irregularities and making a perfectly level surface. The full
    extent of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</span> flooring has not yet been ascertained. For two feet
    between the level of this cement flooring and the furnace-slag soil
    under the foundations of the west wall is fine silted soil. Evidently
    the later wall was erected at a very considerable period subsequently
    to the laying of the cement flooring and after the siltation of the
    soil, and also after the gold-smelting operations had been extensively
    carried on for a long period.</p>

  <p>(<i>e</i>) No single relic of any great antiquity has been found by any
    explorer or prospector in the western portion of the temple, while the
    eastern portion has yielded at depth great quantities of phalli and of
    every relic believed to be associated with the earliest occupiers.</p>

  <p>The oldest “find” in the western half of the building is pronounced
    by Dr. Budge to be of a period dating from between the thirteenth and
    fifteenth centuries of this era, and other “finds” relate to the same
    and later periods.</p>

  <h3>WRITER’S CONCLUSIONS</h3>

  <p>The writer is now and for the above and further considerations, and
    after two years’ residence within the ruins, perfectly convinced of the
    following:—</p>

  <p>(1) That on the departure of the ancient builders and occupiers the
    temple became a ruin, and remained as such for some centuries, the west
    wall disappearing in the meantime (as explained later); (2) that some
    organised Arab people, possibly a split of the numerous Arab colonies
    and kingdoms which existed down the East African coast, possibly of the
    Magdoshu kingdom, who, according to De Barros, reached Sofala (1100
    <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), exploited the gold mines, and formed a mixed population
    between the Arabs and natives, or possibly the Arabs of Quiloa, who
    secured as suzerain power Sofala and the kingdom of the Monomotapa
    (Rhodesia). One of these peoples is believed to be responsible for
    the ruins of Inyanga, which the writer after examining these remains
    does not consider to be ancient in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</span> the fullest sense of the term. One
    of these peoples are also believed to be responsible for making the
    “<em>old</em> workings,” the distinction between which and the “<em>ancient</em>
    workings” must always be kept in mind, a distinction which the late Mr.
    Telford Edwards always pointed out and insisted upon, and concerning
    which recent investigations prove him to have been correct; (3) that
    these Arabs made Zimbabwe their headquarters, to which the washed gold
    dust was brought to be converted into ingots for transport; (4) that
    these Arabs carried on extensive gold-smelting operations at the west
    end of the temple in the shelter of the massive walls, which would
    protect them against the prevailing winds and drifting rains; (5) that
    <em>after</em> carrying on these gold-smelting operations extensively and for
    a considerable period, they built a wall across the open space and
    upon their furnace-slag beds, possibly employing native labour (the
    Makalanga being notorious for their skill in wall building); and (6)
    that these Arabs also built several of the enclosures in the central
    and western parts of the temple to suit their special convenience, and
    altogether regardless of the buried foundations of the ancient builders.</p>

  <h3>DESTRUCTION OF THE ORIGINAL WEST WALL</h3>

  <p>It may be asked what caused the destruction of the original west
    wall. Its disappearance may be accounted for as follows. The south
    and west walls have for centuries borne the full brunt of all the
    torrential rain and storm water which rushes to these points from the
    Bentberg Kopjes, which lie close to the temple on the south side. This
    accounts for the great depth of silted soil which buries the old cement
    flooring. This must have washed the lower portions of the walls till
    the cement foundations decomposed and brought down the structure as it
    has done at other ruins at Zimbabwe. The writer at the commencement
    of his first rainy season<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</span> at Zimbabwe found a large pool about 30
    yds. in length, 15 yds. in breadth, and 2 ft. in depth up against the
    present west wall, towards which all surface water from the higher
    ground rushed unchanged. This had been going on every rainy season for
    many generations, with the result of forming large cavities under the
    foundations, and of keeping the wall in a constant drip with damp even
    at noontide, and of causing the spread of large moss over the walls,
    while shrubs and small trees grew out of the walls at some height from
    their base. Trenches and runs-off and banks soon cured this evil, and
    now the walls have changed from being black with damp to being grey
    with dryness. The moss has naturally flaked off, and the trees and
    shrubs in the walls are dead, owing to lack of moisture.</p>

  <div class="center mt5">THE ACROPOLIS RUINS</div>

  <h3>WESTERN TEMPLE</h3>

  <p>Operations in this temple since the description of the earlier work
    was embodied in the text of this volume have been carried on to June,
    1904. Soil to a depth of from 3 ft. to 5 ft. was removed from the whole
    of the eastern portion of this area. The excavations showed several
    layers of native clay floors one above another. The “finds” were those
    known to be of native origin, though not made by natives of to-day. The
    later or native period of gold manufacture was greatly in evidence,
    beaten gold, gold tacks, and gold wire being frequently met with in
    association with copper sheathing, copper assegai- and arrow-heads, the
    copper containing no alloy.</p>

  <p>A trial hole sunk to a depth of 6 ft. below this cleared portion of
    the temple area, or 9 ft. below the surface as it appeared in 1903,
    showed in its sides the lines of several clay floors and the side of a
    Kafir clay hut, now quite de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxix">xxix</span>composed and soft. At the bottom of the
    pit a rough pavement of closely-fitting stones of irregular shape and
    size was come upon, and the articles found were identical with those
    discovered at a higher level.</p>

  <p>The clearing of the area also disclosed clay sides of huts with the
    remains of short walls of stone radiating from the sides of the huts.
    The wall which Mr. Bent considered might have been the “altar” was
    found to be the radiating wall of a similar hut built upon a higher
    level. These small radiating walls are a general feature of exceedingly
    old native huts found at several places at Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p>A large circular platform of granite cement was also disclosed. This
    spot yielded beaten gold of native make.</p>

  <h3>A ZIMBABWE REVIVAL</h3>

  <p>The writer believes that between the thirteenth and fifteenth
    centuries, or slightly earlier, a great influx of people took place
    at Zimbabwe, and that the majority of the minor ruins in the Valley
    of Ruins were built about this period. This is shown by the number of
    walls built across exceedingly old débris heaps of native origin, by
    the “finds” of Arabian articles on their lowest floors, and by the fact
    that no relic of greater age than that period has been found. Two or
    three of the better-built minor ruins have the appearance of greater
    age, and some of the relics found in this class of ruins are of the
    oldest type. No one who had not spent considerable time at Zimbabwe
    could have any possible conception of the immense population present
    here at a period of but a few centuries ago. The remains of their stone
    walls are scattered thickly over the valleys and hillsides of Zimbabwe.
    The Makalanga state these are all Makalanga of generations long passed
    away. Some are constructions by indigenous peoples, and certainly they
    are not ancient, though largely built of stones quarried from the
    ancient ruins, and the “finds” are those of old native type, including
    Arab articles.</p>

  <h3>PRESERVATION OF RUINS</h3>

  <p>The thanks of all scientific circles, and of South Africans generally,
    are due to Sir W. H. Milton, Administrator of Rhodesia, whose great
    interest in the preservation of the ancient monuments in these
    territories is well known, and to whose direction is due the recent
    and timely preservation work at Great Zimbabwe. The author desires
    to express his personal indebtedness to Sir William Milton for
    the adequate arrangements made by him while engaged in his recent
    researches at the Great Zimbabwe.</p>

  <h3>PLAN OF ELLIPTICAL TEMPLE</h3>

  <p>The clearing of the Elliptical Temple and its vicinity has enabled Mr.
    Franklin White, <span class="smcap">m.e.</span>, Bulawayo, to prepare the latest and so
    far the most perfect plan of that building, and this he has kindly
    placed at the service of the author.</p>

  <p>Indebtedness is also expressed to Professor A. H. Keane, <span class="smcap">ll.d.</span>
    (author of <cite>The Gold of Ophir</cite>), for the contribution of the
    <i>Introduction</i> to this volume; to Mrs. Theodore Bent for generously
    permitting the use in this volume of illustrations from <em>The Ruined
    Cities of Mashonaland</em>; to Mr. Gray, Chief Veterinary Surgeon,
    Salisbury, Mr. H. S. Meilandt, Government Roads Inspector, Bulawayo,
    and Trooper Wenham, <span class="smcap">b.s.a.p.</span>, Victoria, for permission to
    reproduce certain photographs of the ruins, and also to the Directors
    of the British South Africa Company for permission to include the map
    of Rhodesia in this work.</p>

      INTRODUCTION<br /><br />
      <span class="small">BY A. H. KEANE, LL.D.</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">AN archæological work of absorbing interest, such as the volume here
    presented to the reader, needs no introduction. Nor are the following
    remarks meant to be taken in that sense, but only as a sort of “missing
    link” in the chain of evidence between past and present, between the
    Arabian Himyarites and the Rhodesian monuments, the forging of which
    the author has entrusted to me. In <cite>The Ancient Ruins of Rhodesia</cite>,
    of which <cite>Great Zimbabwe</cite> is the inevitable outcome, Messrs. Hall and
    Neal did not discuss the problem of origins, speculation was distinctly
    eschewed, and although their personal views were, and are, in harmony
    with those of all competent observers, they made no dogmatic statement
    on the subject, leaving the main conclusion to be inferred from the
    great body of evidence which they patiently accumulated on the spot
    and embodied in their monumental work. In <cite>Great Zimbabwe</cite>, of which
    Mr. Hall is sole author, and the rich materials for which he has alone
    brought together, the same attitude of reserve is still maintained,
    perhaps even more severely, and therefore it is that he has now invited
    me to develop the argument by which, as he hopes and I believe, the
    wonderful prehistoric remains strewn over Southern Rhodesia, but
    centred chiefly in the Great Zimbabwe group, may be finally traced to
    their true source in South Arabia, Phœnicia, and Palestine.</p>

  <p>In <cite>The Gold of Ophir, whence Brought and by Whom</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxii">xxxii</span>where several
    chapters are devoted to this subject, I inferred, on plausible grounds,
    that the Havilah of Scripture—“the whole land of Havilah where there is
    gold”—was the mineralised region between the Zambesi and the Limpopo,
    and that the ancient gold-workings of this region were first opened
    and the associated monuments erected by the South Arabian Himyarites,
    followed in the time of Solomon by the Jews and Phœnicians. I further
    endeavoured to show that all these Semitic treasure-seekers reached
    Havilah (the port of which was Tharshish, probably the present
    Sofala) through Madagascar, where they had settlements and maintained
    protracted commercial and social intercourse with the Malagasy natives;
    and lastly, that the produce of the mines was by them sent down to
    the coast and shipped at Tharshish for Ophir, the great Himyaritic
    emporium on the south coast of Arabia, whence it was distributed over
    the eastern world. It followed that the scriptural “gold of Ophir” did
    not mean the gold mined at Ophir, which was not, as hitherto supposed,
    an auriferous land, but a gold mart.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The expression meant the gold
    imported by the Jews and Phœnicians from Havilah (Rhodesia), <i>viâ</i>
    Tharshish, Ophir, and Ezion-geber in Idumæa, at the head of the Red Sea.</p>

  <p>It is needless here to recapitulate in detail the arguments that I have
    advanced in support of this general thesis. But I should like to point
    out that if one or two of them have been invalidated by my critics,
    several have been greatly strengthened by the fresh evidence that has
    accumulated since the appearance of <cite>The Gold of Ophir</cite>.</p>

  <p>Of course, incomparably the most important mass of fresh evidence is
    that which has been brought together by Mr. Hall himself during his
    two years’ researches amid the central <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiii">xxxiii</span>group of ruins, and is now
    permanently embodied in <cite>Great Zimbabwe</cite>. Yet the work has in a sense
    been but begun; it has reached down only to the ancient flooring which
    has still to be explored; and we are assured by Sir John Willoughby,
    a most competent authority, that after two months’ exploring the
    wonderful Elliptical Temple with a large gang of labourers, two years
    will yet be needed to complete the surface work of that structure
    alone, without touching the old floors. Mr. Hall infers that three
    further years will be required for the Acropolis itself, besides the
    “Valley of Ruins,” with the groups of buildings extending in all
    directions for over a mile from the temple. A mere glance at some of
    the finely reproduced photographs creates a sense of awe and amazement
    at the huge size and solidity of the containing walls with their
    patiently interwoven chevron and other patterns, and at the vast
    extent of the ground covered by these great monuments of a forgotten
    past. Their erection must have taken many scores of years, one might
    say centuries, and their builders must consequently have dwelt for
    many generations in the land which they so diligently exploited for
    its underground treasures. Here and in all the other strictly mining
    districts they carried on their operations in the midst of hostile
    native populations, as is sufficiently evident from the strongholds
    crowning so many strategical heights, from the formidable ramparts and
    the immense strength of the outer walls, everywhere rounding off in
    long narrow passages leading to the inner enclosures.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_xxxii">
    <img src="images/i_xxxii.jpg" width="386" height="700" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Under such conditions it will naturally be asked, whence did the
    foreign intruders obtain their food supplies? The answer to this
    question is suggested in <cite>The Ancient Ruins</cite>, where it is pointed out
    (p. 208) that the auriferous reefs of the central Zimbabwe district,
    and generally of all the districts in immediate proximity to the
    fortified stations, show no traces of having ever been worked for
    the precious metal. “Possibly the reason for the ancients ignoring
    the gold-reefs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiv">xxxiv</span> of this district [Zimbabwe] lies in the fact that
    the country round about is exceedingly well suited for agricultural
    purposes, the soil being rich and water plentiful, and all vegetable
    growths prolific and profuse. The large population of ancients,
    together with the enormous gangs of slaves, would naturally consume
    a vast quantity of grain, and this necessity would create a large
    agricultural class, who, for their own safety and for the protection
    of their crops and fruits, would naturally carry on their operations
    within such an area as could be safeguarded by the fortresses of
    Zimbabwe.”</p>

  <p>It might at first sight be supposed that the food supplies were drawn
    chiefly from the extensive agricultural settlements of the Inyanga
    territory, on the northern slopes of Mashonaland, which drain through
    the Ruenga and its numerous affluents to the right bank of the Zambesi.
    This Inyanga district may be roughly described, from the archæological
    point of view, as an area of old aqueducts, of old terraced slopes,
    and of old ruins of a less imposing type than the Zimbabwe remains.
    In a notice of <cite>The Ancient Ruins of Rhodesia</cite> contributed to the
    <cite>Geographical Journal</cite> for April, 1902, I first drew attention to the
    surprising analogy, or rather identity, between these terraces and
    those of the South Arabian uplands visited by General E. T. Haig in the
    eighties. So close is the parallelism that Haig’s description might
    almost change places with Mr. Telford Edwards’ account of the Inyanga
    works quoted in <cite>The Ancient Ruins</cite>, p. 353 <i>sq.</i>, as thus:—</p>

          <p>“In one district the whole mountain side, for a height of 6,000
            ft., was terraced from top to bottom. Everywhere, above, below,
            and all around, endless flights of terraced walls meet the eye.
            One can hardly realise the enormous amount of labour, toil,
            and perseverance which these represent. The terraced walls are
            usually from 4 to 5 ft. in height, but towards the top of the
            mountain they are sometimes as much as 15 or 18 ft. They are
            built entirely of rough stone laid without mortar. I reckoned
            on an average that each wall retains a terrace not more than
            twice its own height in width, and I do not think I saw a
            single breach in one of them unrepaired” (Haig, <cite>Proceedings

            convey any idea of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxv">xxxv</span>the immensity of labour implied in the
            enormous number of these ancient terraces. I saw at least
            150 square miles composed of kopjes from 100 to 400 ft. in
            height literally strewn with the ruins. A contemplation of the
            enormous tonnage of stones and earth rudely built into these
            terraces left me amazed. It appears to be abundantly clear
            that the terraces were for the purpose of cultivating cereals
            of some sort. The terraces as a rule rise up in vertical lifts
            of about 2 or 3 ft., and extend backwards over a distance of
            mostly 7 to 12 ft. The terraces are all made very flat and of
            dry masonry, not of hewn stone.”</p>

  <p>But Mr. Hall, who visited the Inyanga territory in May, 1904, now finds
    that the terraced slopes,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the so-called “slave-pits,” and the other
    remains, although “old,” are not “ancient.” That is to say, they date
    not from Himyaritic times, but probably from the eleventh or twelfth
    century of the new era, when parts of Rhodesia were reoccupied by
    large numbers of Moslem Arabs from Quiloa and their other settlements
    along the east coast. Hence, although the terraced slopes still form a
    connecting link between South Africa and South Arabia, the South Arabia
    here in question is that, not of pre-, but of post-Koranic times.</p>

  <p>Of course, the ruined houses and ruined aqueducts are too much
    obliterated to supply any clear points of comparison. But their mere
    presence, and especially the vast extent of ground covered by them,
    will suffice to confirm Mr. Telford <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvi">xxxvi</span>Edwards’ estimate of the vast
    numbers of civilised peoples who inhabited the rich Inyanga valleys
    in prehistoric times, and whom we may now call Sabæans, Minæans, and
    others Himyarites.</p>

  <p>Were the houses still extant, we should expect to find them covered
    with the same decorative mural motives as are still seen both on the
    Zimbabwe monuments and on the public buildings of Sana, present capital
    of Arabia Felix. Manzoni, who visited this city three times between
    the years 1877 and 1880, figures a mansion six stories high, which is
    richly ornamented with two such motives—the chevron and the vertical
    block pattern—closely resembling those everywhere occurring on the more
    ancient Rhodesian walls. The chevron, which is seen both in single and
    double courses exactly as on the great walls of the Elliptical Temple,
    is absolutely identical, while the block design differs only in being
    quite vertical at Sana, whereas it is slightly tilted, or else two rows
    of blocks converge to produce the herring-bone pattern on the Rhodesian
    walls, as at Little Umnukwana and many other places. The reader
    will find Manzoni’s mansion reproduced in Mr. D. G. Hogarth’s <cite>The
    Penetration of Arabia</cite>, 1904, p. 198, and he will there notice that the
    various motives fill up all the space between two parallel horizontal
    lines, as is so often the case in Rhodesia.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Here, therefore, style,
    motive, general treatment, everything corresponds between the Rhodesian
    remains and the decorative fancies still flourishing in Sana, heir to
    the cultural traditions of the neighbouring Mariaba and of the other
    ancient Himyaritic capitals in South Arabia.</p>

  <p>In <cite>The Gold of Ophir</cite> frequent reference is made to the relations,
    social and commercial, established between Palestine and Madagascar
    certainly as early as the time of Solomon, and possibly even during
    the reign of his father David. On this point I might have spoken even
    more confidently, for I have since received a communication from M.
    Alfred <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvii">xxxvii</span>Grandidier, by far the greatest living authority on all
    things Malagasy, who calls my attention to the evidence supplied in
    his monumental work, <cite>Histoire Physique, Naturelle et Politique de
    Madagascar</cite> (1901), of intercourse between the Jews and the natives
    of Madagascar and neighbouring islands even in pre-Solomonic days.
    Documents are quoted to show that the Comoros, stepping-stones between
    Madagascar and Rhodesia, were peopled in the reign of Solomon “by Arabs
    or rather by Idumæan Jews from the Red Sea,” and that the people of the
    great island preserve many Israelitish rites, usages, and traditions,
    cherish the memory of Adam, Abraham, Lot, Moses, Gideon, but have no
    knowledge of any of the prophets after the time of David, “which seems
    to show that the Jewish immigrants left their home at a very remote
    date, since if the exodus had been recent they could not have forgotten
    the great names posterior to the time of David.” Hence he concludes
    that “there is nothing surprising in the presence of an Idumæan colony
    in Madagascar, for we know that from the very earliest times the Arabs
    of Yemen had frequented the East African seaboard at least as far as
    Sofala.” These words lend further support to my identification of
    Tharshish with Sofala, and in a note it is added that “the Jews and
    Arabian Semites were not the only peoples who had formerly commercial
    relations with the inhabitants of the African seaboard. From time
    immemorial these southern waters were navigated by the fleets of the
    Egyptians, probably even of the Chaldeans, Babylonians, Assyrians,
    Phœnicians, Tyrians” (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 96). And again at p. 100: “From
    the earliest times the Indian Ocean was traversed by Chaldean,
    Egyptian, Jewish, Arab, Persian, Indian, and other vessels.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>
  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxviii">xxxviii</span></p>
  <p>My statements regarding the long-standing relations of the Northern
    Semites with the peoples of Madagascar and South Africa as far as
    Sofala are thus fully supported by the greatest authority on the
    subject. But there are some minds so constituted that they seem
    incapable of accepting a new revelation. They can do nothing but <i>stare
    super vias antiquas</i>, and will strain every nerve to minimise the force
    of facts and arguments pointing at conclusions which run counter to
    their deep-rooted prejudices. I here reproduce the famous “Zimbabwe
    Zodiac” (Fig. 2.), which was found near Great Zimbabwe, and shows the
    twelve signs of the Zodiac carved round the rim, as described by the
    late Dr. Schlichter in the <cite>Geographical Journal</cite> for April, 1890. This
    specialist tells us that “the signs coincide in every respect with
    other finds which Bent and others have made in Zimbabwe. One of the
    pictures is an image of the sun analogous to the sun-pictures which
    Mauch and Bent found on the monoliths of Zimbabwe, and <em>analogous also
    to finds in Asia Minor which belong to the Assyro-Babylonian period</em>.”
    But a writer in the <cite>Guardian</cite> attempts to destroy the significance of
    this document by asserting that the Zodiac or its nomenclature is of
    Greek origin and consequently of no great age. Now the Hon. Emmeline M.
    Plunket has recently (1903) published a work on <cite>Ancient Calendars and
    Constellations</cite>, in which she maintains that the Babylonian Calendar,
    with its Zodiacal signs, dates from 6000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, that is, about
    8,000 years ago. It is true that this estimate is not clearly made out.
    But on the other hand, the reader may be assured that Miss Plunket does
    not hold by the “Greek” theory. Nor does F. Delitzsch, who reminds us
    that “when we distinguish twelve signs of the Zodiac and call them
    Ram, Bull, Twins, etc., in all this the Sumero-Babylonian culture is
    still a living influence down to the present day.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Nor does Sayce,
    who points out that the Babylonian account of the Flood occurs in the
    eleventh book <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxix">xxxix</span>of the epic of Gisdhubar corresponding approximately
    with the eleventh sign of the Zodiac, at that time <i>Aquarius</i>, just
    as the fifth book records the death of a monstrous lion by Gisdhubar,
    answering to the Zodiacal <i>Leo</i> and so on. He further observes that
    “the Zodiacal signs had been marked out and named at that remote period
    (certainly before 2000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>), when the sun was still in Taurus
    at the beginning of spring,”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and, let me add, when the Greeks had
    not yet been heard of, but when the great Gnomon, or Conical Tower, had
    possibly already been erected by the Semitic builders of Great Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p>That this and the numerous other conical towers still standing amid
    the crumbling ruins of Rhodesia are all cast in a Semitic mould
    will be at once seen by comparing them with the conical tower of a
    temple, figured on a medallion found at Byblos in Phœnicia and here
    reproduced (Fig. 1.). The comparison may also be extended to the
    two embossed cylinders—one from Great Zimbabwe, the other from the
    Temple of Paphos, in Cyprus, here also reproduced (Figs. 3 and 4) from
    Bent’s <cite>Ruined Cities</cite>, pp. 170, 171. These two objects, so strikingly
    similar in general design, reminded Bent of Herodian’s description of
    the sacred cone in the great Phœnician Temple of the Sun at Emessa,
    in Syria, which was adorned with certain “knobs or protuberances,” a
    pattern supposed by him to represent the sun, and common in phallic
    decorations, such as are constantly turning up with every shovelful of
    débris removed from the Zimbabwe Temple Enclosures.</p>

  <p>But although thousands of stones have been washed and carefully
    examined for inscriptions, none have so far been discovered. As the
    inscription which stood originally above the gateway of Great Zimbabwe,
    as reported by the Arabs to the Portuguese pioneers early in the
    sixteenth century,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> has since disappeared, there are no known written
    documents <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xl">xl</span>connecting these monuments with South Arabia or Phœnicia,
    except a few scratches on the rim of an earthenware vessel figured
    by Bent and by him supposed possibly to be of Himyaritic type.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
    As, on the other hand, South Arabia is covered with Himyaritic rock
    inscriptions, some of considerable length and hitherto reputed to be of
    great age, their absence from Rhodesia has naturally caused surprise.
    This negative argument has even by some of my critics been allowed to
    outweigh the overwhelming positive evidence derived from the monuments
    themselves, from the hundreds of old gold-workings already described
    or recorded, from the multitude of objects—phalli, birds, conic
    towers—which have been found in the ruins, and are, beyond all doubt,
    intimately associated with Semitic religious observances. But I think
    it may now be shown that this “negative argument” is no proof at all
    of non-Semitic origins, but, on the contrary, affords strong indirect
    evidence of the great antiquity of these Semitic remains in Rhodesia.</p>

  <p>It is to be noticed, in the first place, that although the
    Phœnicians are believed to have migrated from the Persian Gulf to
    the Mediterranean about three millenniums before the New Era, no
    Phœnician inscriptions have yet been anywhere discovered in the
    Mediterranean lands older than about the seventh or the eighth century
    <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Before that time the Phœnicians, like the kindred
    Canaanites and Israelites, were rude, uncultured peoples, with no
    knowledge of letters, except, perhaps, of the hieroglyphs, cuneiforms,
    and other scripts of their Egyptian, Assyro-Babylonian, Hittite,
    and Cretan neighbours. Even the Moabite Stone, if it be genuine, is
    post-Solomonic, since its reputed “author” was the Moabite king, Mesha,
    contemporary of Jehoram of Israel and Jehoshaphat of Judah. How, then,
    could the unlettered Jews and Phœnicians of the time of David, Solomon,
    and Hiram leave any written records of themselves in Rhodesia? After
    that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xli">xli</span>epoch the intercourse with South Africa was interrupted,
    because “Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold;
    but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber” (1 Kings
    xxii. 48). And then the star of Jacob waned, and the scattering of the
    Ten Tribes of Israel was presently followed by the dire calamities
    that fell upon Judah, and put an end for ever to all further quest of
    treasure in the Austral seas.</p>

  <p>In the second place I find that Semitic students are gradually coming
    to the conclusion that the age of the South Arabian rock inscriptions
    has been greatly exaggerated, especially by Glaser, whose authority
    was at first naturally accepted almost without demur. The language is,
    no doubt, Himyaritic, that is to say, the oldest known form of Arabic.
    But that language survived for many centuries after the New Era in
    the Axumite empire, Abyssinia, where it is called <i>Geez</i>, and in Yemen
    till some time after the Mohammedan irruption, and is still current in
    the island of Sokotra, and in the Mahra district east of Hadramaut,
    where it is called <i>Ehkili</i>. Hence the language of the inscriptions
    is no test of their antiquity, though many afford intrinsic evidence
    that they date certainly from at least a few hundred years before the
    New Era. The subject is at present <i>sub judice</i>, and no more can be
    said until the full results are known of the extensive researches now
    in progress throughout Yemen. Here a large number of agents of the
    French Ministère de l’Instruction Publique have been at work since
    the year 1901, and thousands of impressions or rubbings have already
    (1903–4) been received in Paris. Some have even begun to appear in
    the <cite>Nouveaux Textes Yéménites</cite>, edited by M. Derenbourg, and several
    of the inscriptions are stated to be in a hitherto unknown alphabet
    quite different from that of the Himyaritic document which forms the
    frontispiece of the <cite>Gold of Ophir</cite>. Great revelations may therefore be
    pending; but, meanwhile, so much may, I think, be safely inferred, that
    the Himyarites<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlii">xlii</span> who first arrived in Rhodesia, worked the mines, and
    built the monuments, some dating from apparently 2000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
    had little or no knowledge of letters, or at least had not yet begun
    to cover the rocks of their South Arabian homes with well-formed and
    carefully constructed inscriptions. Thus is also explained the absence
    of all such documents from their new homes in Rhodesia, where one may
    now almost venture to predict that none will ever be found. Nothing
    can be inferred from the vanished inscription over the Great Zimbabwe
    gateway, since the gold-workings appear to have been resumed for a time
    by the later (post-Mohammedan) Arabs, who were fond of decorating the
    façades of their mosques and other public buildings with the ornamental
    but relatively recent (eighth century) Cufic characters.</p>

  <p>Mention should perhaps here be made of Professor Gustav Oppert’s
    <cite>Tharshish and Ophir</cite> (Berlin, 1903), in which the learned author claims
    to offer “a final solution” of the problem. But he leaves the question
    exactly as it stood over three decades ago, is still lost in the tangle
    of time-worn etymologies, and takes no notice at all of the revelations
    made by Messrs. Hall and Neal in the <cite>Ancient Ruins</cite>. The vast body
    of archæological evidence derived in recent years from the Rhodesian
    remains is thus completely ignored, and fresh light excluded from
    the only source whence it might have been drawn. On the other hand,
    Professor Oppert, rather than admit a Tharshish in the Indian Ocean,
    suggests that the <em>Tharshish</em> of Kings and Chronicles either means
    “the sea,” possibly the origin of the Greek word [Greek: thalatta]
    itself, or else was by the authors of those books foisted into the
    texts instead of Ophir. Hence where <em>Tharshish</em> occurs as the objective
    of Solomon’s gold expeditions we are to read <em>Ophir</em>, although the
    original Ophir is allowed to have been where I place it on the south
    coast of Arabia. Now the Greek word [Greek: thalatta] is Homeric, and
    when the Homeric poems were first sung there were no Greeks in the
    Indian Ocean.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xliii">xliii</span> Hence, even if the wild etymology could be admitted, it
    would not serve, and this essay cannot be accepted as “a final solution
    of the old controversy.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It is pleasant to be able to add that my
    solution has been accepted as final by some of Professor Oppert’s
    fellow-countrymen—the editor of the <cite>Coloniale Zeitung</cite> amongst
    others—who declares that “the problem seems now really solved.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

  <p>Let me conclude with a question. Those who still reject my solution,
    who cast about for the gold of Ophir all over the Indian Ocean—Egypt,
    Arabia, Persia, India—anywhere except South Africa, what do they
    propose doing with the hundreds of old Rhodesian workings, which are
    known to have yielded at least £75,000,000 in their time, and with
    the stupendous Semitic monuments connected with these workings, of
    which Mr. Hall here presents the public with scores of photographic
    reproductions, drawn exclusively from the central Great Zimbabwe group?
    Where does India, the spoilt child of the etymologists, stand beside
    these remains, which betray such undoubted evidence of their South
    Arabian origin?</p>

  <div class="subheadc">First Impressions—View from Acropolis Hill</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">ON the 21st May, 1902, I arrived at Victoria in Mashonaland, <i>en route</i>
    to the ruins of the Great Zimbabwe, which lie about seventeen miles
    south-east of the township. In 1891, when the late Mr. Theodore Bent
    visited Zimbabwe, he occupied exactly one week in covering the distance
    between Victoria and the ruins. Unfortunately for him and his party, he
    had been advised to follow the Moshagashi Valley, instead of taking the
    higher ground towards the west, and consequently he experienced great
    difficulty with his wagons in crossing spruits, rivers, and swamps,
    which are numerous in that direction.</p>

  <p>There is now an excellent road to Zimbabwe, and the distance can be
    covered by a cyclist well within an hour and a half, while visitors
    driving can now arrive at Zimbabwe early in the morning and spend the
    whole day among the ruins and yet be in town in ample time for the
    evening meal. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>distance by road is seventeen miles, and by a native
    path cutting across country it is reduced to fifteen miles.</p>

  <p>Victoria is a town with barely one hundred white inhabitants. It is the
    centre of the largest and finest grain country of Southern Rhodesia,
    and the opening up of the gold, copper, and coal areas of the Sabi
    district will tend to increase its importance.</p>

  <p>The Acting-Civil Commissioner, Mr. Lawlor, arranged for requisitions to
    be made for stores, plant, etc., required for the work at the ruins,
    and the Officer Commanding the British South Africa Police provided
    wagon and ten mules to transport stores out to Zimbabwe. The Native
    Commissioner, Mr. Alfred Drew, sent out M’Guti, a native police boy,
    to the chief Mogabe, who lives near the ruins and rules over a large
    tract of country and is practically independent, to find fifteen “boys”
    (afterwards increased to forty) to be at our camp at Zimbabwe at sun-up
    on Saturday. The work of collecting stores and plant filled up the rest
    of the day.</p>

  <p>Early the following morning we loaded up the wagon and left for
    Great Zimbabwe, arriving at the main ruins at midday. The wagon was
    off-loaded, and in the shade of a large candelabra-shaped euphorbia
    tree we lunched, while the “boys” carried the stores up on to a low
    granite knoll, where were three spacious native huts, built for the
    Civil Commissioner, and occupied by Lord Milner in 1897. Of course,
    half the population of Mogabe’s kraal came down the kopje sides in
    black strings to watch all that took place, and a jabbering, laughing,
    noisy crowd they were. There was not a pair of trousers or a vest among
    the lot, and all were absolutely bare, save for their aprons. I liked
    their appearance better than that of the average Matabele, for they had
    better and more genial faces, and were not at all haughty and reserved.</p>

  <p>The camp is within a few feet of the north side of No. 3 Ruins (see
    map), and faces the south side of Zimbabwe Hill, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>and the Acropolis
    Ruins are on the summit of a very precipitous cliff, 90 ft. high,
    forming part of the side of the hill, the ruins being 220 ft. directly
    above the camp. The camp of Mr. Theodore Bent, the archæologist, was a
    third of a mile to the south of our camp. Ours is the more convenient
    spot, as it is half-way between the two principal ruins, and close to
    its east side lies “The Valley of Ruins,” beside which the situation is
    far healthier.</p>

  <p>Leaving the “boys” to move the stores and plant from our outspan up to
    the huts, we started for a visit to the Elliptical Temple, which can be
    seen from the camp. My friends, Mr. Herbert Hayles, of Victoria, and
    Mr. J. R. A. Gell (cousin of Mr. Lyttelton Gell, one of the directors
    of the British South Africa Company), had accompanied me out to
    Zimbabwe to show me the lie of the Zimbabwe Reserve, and to protect me
    for the first night of my stay in the event of any visits from ancient
    ghosts.</p>

  <p>Approaching the west entrance to the Elliptical Temple one is
    confronted by the following notice:—</p>

  <p>“<em>The public are warned that digging or prospecting for gold,
    whether alluvial or otherwise, or for curiosities and relics of
    any sort within the Zimbabwe Reserve, is strictly prohibited
    without special permission, and that any person or persons
    found so doing or in any way damaging any of the ruins or
    cutting or damaging any tree or trees within such Reserve will
    be prosecuted. And notice is also hereby given that nobody will
    be allowed to erect any habitation of any kind whatever within
    the Reserve without special permission. By Order.</em>”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

  <p>But turning from this prosaic notice to the walls themselves, one
    saw that every stone of this stupendous and imposing structure had
    gained glories from the hands of Time, and yielded a magnificent
    subject for the painter’s brush. The walls were white with lichen,
    but on their surfaces were <span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>splashed art colourings of almost every
    possible shade—bright orange and red, lemon-black, sea-green, and pale
    delicate yellow—while drooping from the summits were heavy festoons of
    the pink-flowered “Zimbabwe creeper.” Over the fallen blocks spread
    sprays of passion flowers, convolvuli, and other delicate creepers, and
    clusters of St. John’s lilies and large scarlet gladioli rose stately
    above beds of rich vegetation. Here was one of Nature’s most perfect
    chromographs!</p>

  <p>To describe this grand ruin in one chapter would be an utterly
    impossible task, and any statement of one’s first impressions on
    walking about the temple ’mid its massive Titanic walls must be
    altogether inadequate. At any rate, one experienced an overwhelming
    and oppressive sense of awe and reverence. One felt it impossible to
    speak loudly or to laugh. And yet the ancient builders were what is
    termed Pagan—Phallic worshippers with Baal and Astoroth among their
    divinities, but a people so skilled in Zodiacal, astronomical, and
    other sciences as to amaze and perplex the savants of to-day. Standing
    close by the Sacred Cone, near which, according to Colonel Conder, the
    Syro-Arabian archæologist, the altar was placed, one felt disinclined
    for conversation. Above on a bough was a large owl, with prominent
    ears and beautiful yellow eyes, who stared at our daring to trespass
    on the verge of mystery. At our feet lay innumerable cast-off skins
    of snakes. One thought of the poet Lowell’s <cite>Lost Angel</cite>, where,
    speaking of a man so deadening his conscience by constant refusals to
    listen to the appeals of his attendant good angel, he finds that the
    angel has at last left him alone. Then was the temple of his heart
    become desecrated, “the owl and snake inhabit there, the image of the
    God has gone!” The owl and snake inhabit the Temple of Zimbabwe, the
    altar of which is now broken down and desecrated, but the odious and
    unmistakable emblems of Nature Worship are still to be found by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
    score. Reverence of the hoary age of these buildings seizes one, for
    some accredited archæologists give the age of some of these ruins as
    anterior to the time of Moses. One wonders whether Professor Keane’s
    contention is correct, that Ancient Rhodesia was the Havilah of
    Genesis, especially when one thinks of the estimated £75,000,000 of
    gold believed to have been taken by the Ancients from the surface of
    the gold-reefs of this country before and during the Biblical-Ophir
    period.</p>

  <p>But our stay within these massive walls was brief. The writer would
    have over two years in which to wander in their labyrinthine passages,
    and to examine their architectural features, and compare them with
    those of Rhodesian ruins elsewhere, but his friends must start back to
    Victoria before sunrise next day. On our way to the other important
    ruins—the Acropolis or Hill Fortress—we visited the grave of Major Alan
    Wilson and his party<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> who were killed on the Shangani during the
    flight of King Lo ’Bengula in 1893.</p>

  <p>We climbed up the 230 feet to the Acropolis ruins, but our visit here
    also was brief. We clambered round the summits of the walls of the two
    temples, which have a score of monoliths still standing, more or less
    erect, and penetrated some of the most intricate passages. The feeling
    experienced here was one of intense wonder and bewilderment at the
    stupendous walls erected at such a height, walls which must have taken
    years to build, and all of granite blocks. The view from the summit
    is among the finest in Rhodesia. We watched the sunset glow fading on
    the white walls of the Elliptical Temple below, and then descended to
    prepare the huts for the night and arrange the stores in their proper
    quarters. Later, when the round moon one day off the full was shining,
    we sat outside the huts watching the effects shown on the western
    temple on the hill where the monoliths high up above us stood out
    against the greenish moonlit sky. At 4 a.m. the mules were inspanned in
    the wagon, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>and my friends took their departure, leaving me alone among
    ruins and natives.</p>

  <p>As soon as the sun was fairly up, M’Guti, the native police boy,
    arrived from Mogabe’s kraal, followed by a crowd of “boys,” all most
    anxious for work. The majority were young men, and the total clothing
    of the crowd did not amount to three square yards of calico. They all
    squatted down in a semi-circle in front of the main hut while M’Guti
    delivered a long oration, but as he was wearing khaki regimentals and
    had his steel handcuffs (evidently a badge of authority) lying in front
    of him, the sustaining influence of office possessed him. Finally, all
    the details were settled, a roll was made up, and the names recorded.</p>

  <p>Later, the Mogabe, Handisibishe, and his headmen arrived, and a
    long <i>indaba</i> took place, M’Guti interpreting. Mogabe recognised
    the likenesses of Mr. and Mrs. Bent, and that of the previous
    Mogabe—Chipfuno, his brother. Salt and tobacco sent Mogabe happy away,
    and next day a large gourd of <i>doro</i> (native beer) and some sweet
    potatoes arrived at the camp as a present.</p>

  <p>The view from the summit of the Acropolis may be described as follows:—</p>

  <p><i>South.</i>—Towards the south and in the nearer distance, and 250 feet
    below in the valley, the venerable and lichened walls of the Elliptical
    Temple rise out of luxuriantly green vegetation. So much below
    the Acropolis cliffs is this temple that one sees over its broken
    north walls into the interior and on to the floors of some of the
    enclosures. The summit of the conical tower peeps out from among the
    giant fig-trees that flourish in the interior of the building. At this
    distance the white monoliths along the eastern wall, though clearly
    defined against the dark foliage, seem dwarfed. In almost the same line
    of view, but slightly eastwards and nearer, and on the north-east side
    of the temple, is the “Valley of Ruins,” full of enclosures, passages,
    entrances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span> and walls, which up to 1902 had remained practically
    unexplored by white men. Nearer still is the wagon-track passing
    Havilah Camp and winding eastwards towards the Mapaku Ruins (“Little
    Zimbabwe”) and the Motelekwe<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> River seven miles distant. A hundred
    yards east of the temple on an open granite space overlooking the
    Valley of Ruins is the site of the camp of Dr. Schlichter, who visited
    the Zimbabwe ruins in 1897. Immediately behind this spot and between it
    and the foot of the Bentberg (<i>Motusa</i>) is the veld land ploughed by
    Messrs. Posselt in 1888–9.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_007">
    <img src="images/i_007.jpg" width="600" height="553" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">GREAT ZIMBABWE RESERVE</div>
  </div>

  <p>Still looking south and slightly eastwards of the temple is the
    Schlichter Gorge, down which the Mapudzi flows towards <span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>the south.
    At the southern end of the gorge is a succession of ranges of kopjes
    of fantastic shape descending into, and again rising from, the
    Mowishawasha Valley, and becoming lost in the blue distance. The
    Bentberg Kopje, which forms a dark background for the temple, shows its
    immense flanks of granite glacis and boulders. Here some fifty years
    ago was the chief local kraal of the Barotse, who had settlements among
    the Makalanga of this part of the country, and on the north-eastern
    side of the hill are still to be seen the remains of ancient walls,
    while a clump of castor-oil trees at the foot of the hill on this side
    marks the site of Theodore Bent’s camp (June and July, 1891).</p>

  <p>Slightly to the west of the temple and almost immediately in front
    of it are No. 1 Ruins, the walls of which are crowned with aloes and
    euphorbias. Less than a hundred yards west of these ruins are the
    Ridge Ruins, on a bare granite ridge, on the east side of which was
    the camp of Sir John Willoughby, who excavated portions of the ruins
    (November and December, 1892). Fifty yards behind the Ridge Ruins is
    the Zimbabwe Spring, marked by a group of trees, where most excellent
    water can be obtained, even during the driest season. It was close
    to these trees that Messrs. Posselt had their camp in 1888–9. Nearer
    than Ridge Ruins is the little graveyard where is the granite tomb of
    Major Alan Wilson and his party. Just a few yards nearer is Havilah
    Camp, where one can just see the natives moving to and fro across the
    open spaces between the huts. Behind the Bentberg and further south is
    broken country, with Lumbo Rocks, one of the landmarks of the district,
    rising from the summit of a rugged hill like a column piled up against
    the sky, its lichen mantle showing brilliant red in the sunset. Here
    is the line of high ground which separates the plateau of Mashonaland
    from the lower valley of the Limpopo River, the incline in the contour
    being both steep and abrupt. This also divides <span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>the watershed of
    the Motelekwe from that of the Tokwe.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> In this southern view are
    scattered many Makalanga kraals, several of which are perched up in
    almost inaccessible rocky eyries; also some romantic valleys, kloofs,
    and stretches of park-like land studded with patches of thick woods.</p>

      showing<br />the general position of each ruin </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>South-west.</i>—Looking towards the south-west and in the near distance
    is the rising ground between the Bentberg and Rusivanga<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> kopjes, and
    the native path leading over it to Bingura’s kraal. At the foot of
    Rusivanga and 150 yards from Havilah Camp, and on a knoll on which is
    a large old tree, was for some time the camp of Adam Renders, known by
    the natives as <i>Sa-adama</i>, who rediscovered Zimbabwe in 1868, and who
    was here visited by Mr. George Philips, the ivory trader of the very
    early days, and by Dr. Karl Mauch, the latter of whom gave in 1871 the
    first information of the ruins for almost three hundred years. Here
    Renders traded extensively for ivory. Previously to Dr. Mauch’s visit
    Renders lived at Nini, eleven miles south-west of Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p>Beyond the nearer ridge is a deep and wide valley on the near side of
    which is Bingura’s kraal, and from this valley the land rises towards
    the southern extremity of the Livouri Mountains some ten miles from
    Zimbabwe, and in the immediate distance, though much nearer the Livouri
    Range, is Providential Pass, through which the hunter, Mr. F. C.
    Selous, led the Pioneer Column in 1890. In the same line of view, but
    slightly nearer, is where Renders’ first station was located.</p>

  <p><i>West.</i>—Looking due west there are two kopjes—Rusivanga and
    Makuma—which close in the Zimbabwe Valley on that side at a third of
    a mile distance. Further west of the two kopjes is a wide undulating
    valley some six or eight miles <span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>wide which runs along the east side of
    the Livouri Mountains, and this is studded at intervals with low and
    bare granite kopjes. The kraal of the dynastic chief Cherimbila is at
    Rovali, at the southern extremity of the range. The highest point of
    the Livouri is Niande, a hill in the centre of this range with steep
    and almost inaccessible sides. Behind the Livouri Range is seen the
    high conical summit of the Cotopaxi Mountain, which forms one of the
    principal landmarks of this portion of Southern Mashonaland. Towards
    the south end of the Livouri Range is a large hill called Mowishawasha.
    <em>Washa</em> is always associated by the natives with power and authority.
    The natives never climb to the top of this hill without going through
    some form of devotion on their way up; also on passing close to the
    hill they will stop and clap hands. Natives will not state the actual
    reason. Probably an important Makalanga chief of some past times was
    buried there. Near to this hill is a smaller one known as Tchib-Fuko,
    which also has some native superstitions attached to it. It was in this
    district the wooden platter with the zodiacal signs was discovered by
    Mr. Edward Muller, also the pot “Fuko-ya-Nebandge.”</p>

  <p><i>North-west.</i>—To the north-west, and on the opposite side of the valley
    at the foot of Zimbabwe Hill, and beyond the <em>Outer Defence Wall</em> which
    encloses the Zimbabwe ruins on the west and north sides, is a low
    granite knoll called Pasosa, with outlying huts belonging to Mogabe’s
    kraal. A few yards behind the huts is a ruin (Pasosa, No. 1), with a
    second ruin (Pasosa, No. 2) 60 yards farther north. The country beyond
    in this direction is the valley land of the Moshagashi River, which
    is some six to eight miles broad, the horizon showing low hills, over
    which are the line of houses and trees of Victoria township, fifteen
    miles distant as the crow flies, and beyond again are the uplands of
    the range north of Victoria. The principal kraals in this direction are
    Baranzimba’s (two miles) and M’Tima’s (three and a half miles).</p>

      VALLEY, ZIMBABWE</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

  <p><i>North.</i>—In the north is the lower continuation of the Moshagashi
    Valley, at this point some eight miles broad. Here the granite
    formation of Zimbabwe terminates and the slate commences. The principal
    kraal, and by far the largest in this area, is that of Chinongu, which
    is four miles from Zimbabwe. Extending from N.N.W. to N.N.E. are the
    high and romantically shaped Besa Mountains, and at their eastern
    extremity can be seen in the blue distance the Lovugwe country.</p>

  <p><i>North-east.</i>—To the north-east, at a distance of eight miles and
    cutting the sky-line, is the range of the Inyuni Hills. Their sides are
    exceedingly steep and, being slate, their contours contrast pleasantly
    with those of the kopjes of the granite formation. In the nearer
    distance is Motuminshaba, a granite kopje four miles away, and farther
    east Tchivi, another granite kopje three miles distant. The land
    towards the east-north-east descends to the Motelekwe River, the valley
    of which can be seen with Arowi, a huge, isolated granite kopje rising
    twelve miles distant, on the far bank of the Motelekwe. In this area
    kraals are numerous.</p>

  <p><i>East.</i>—The Beroma Range (written by Bent as “Veroma”) fills in the
    whole of the background towards the east. These hills, which run north
    and south, appear to be fully four miles long. The most northerly
    point of this range is formed by a large rounded granite kopje called
    Sueba,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and between this hill and Chenga’s<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> kraal is the path
    leading over the nek to the Mapaku Ruins (“Little Zimbabwe”) eight
    miles distant. On the west side of Beroma is a line of lower hills
    forming its shoulders. The southern end of the Beroma Range is formed
    by the high rounded Mount Marsgi, with a series of cliffs on its west
    side, and at its base M’Tijeni’s kraal. Marsgi overlooks the Schlichter
    Gorge. This is the point from which our description started.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">Sunday Morning and Midnight in an Ancient Temple—Sunset on the Acropolis.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">WANDERING about the Elliptical Temple at Zimbabwe on a Sunday morning
    one is faced at every turn with texts for innumerable “sermons in
    stones.” The hoary age of these massive walls is grandly and silently
    eloquent of a dead religion—a religion which was but the blind
    stretching forth of the hand of faith groping in the Dawn of Knowledge
    for the Deity and seeking the Unknown. Lowell urges that none should
    call any faith “vain” which in the evolution of religion has led
    mankind up to a higher level. The builders were “Pagans.” Granted, but
    the world four thousand years ago was in its infancy, and infancy is
    but a necessary prelude to development in any department of life and
    thought. The progressive stages of Old Testament faith demonstrate this
    fact most patently. We of the Christian Era, with our two thousand
    years of religious enlightenment, have yet to learn of the “many things
    I have to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.” The evolution of
    the Christian Ideal has not yet reached its final stage—it has still to
    be perfected. But the period of infancy in development should not be
    too hastily condemned as “vain.”</p>

  <p>The spires that adorn our churches, the orientation of ecclesiastical
    buildings, the eastward position of the dead, the candles on the
    altars, and what is more, the idea conveyed by sacrificial offering,
    have their origin in the ancient faiths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> and world-wide litholatrous
    and solar ideas of the Semitic peoples, whether of Yemen or Phœnicia,
    who built their temples in every part of the then known world which
    came under their influence. In these, as in many more such instances,
    parallelisms become identities, but identities adapted by the Christian
    Church to convey in an old-world form a figure of a higher faith. The
    continuity between this old temple at Zimbabwe, Stonehenge, and the
    modern cathedral, is complete.</p>

  <p>When one reviews the forms and practices, so far as they are known,
    of the Semitic builders of the Great Zimbabwe, what a flood of light
    shines in upon the history and worship of the Hebrews. The writings
    of the Prophets live afresh, and the mystic chapters of Job become
    full of pregnant meaning. A key is provided to the secret of Abraham
    offering his son, to Jacob’s pile of stones, to Jephthah’s vow, to
    the Syro-Phœnician woman’s conversation at the well, and to a hundred
    points of biblical lore which would otherwise barely attract attention,
    much less provoke interest. These old Semites—of whom the Hebrews were
    a younger branch—stinted not their worship, and knew the ecstasy of
    sacrifice. Their best beloved they gave—their dearest, in the belief
    that the gift which was offered without a pang was not prized by
    Deity. Bearing this in mind, the Old Testament is found to be replete
    with unfailing interest, charm, and point; it becomes, in fact, a
    marvellously new book even to the biblical student.</p>

  <p>The builders of the temple at Zimbabwe have now, it is believed,
    slept through three millenniums, if not four, yet the religious faith
    of the Semitic family was so strong, so real, and so forceful, that
    its ramifications can be found in the faith of the Christian Church
    of to-day. Nor can this be wondered at. One has but to glance round
    these temple walls to read in granite blocks the fact that to the
    builders their religious faith was of primal importance. Here is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
    clearly envisaged the fact that to them their religion was very real,
    so much so that were Europe devastated to-morrow, it could scarcely
    show in proportion to its other buildings such monuments to religious
    faith as can be seen in Rhodesia to-day. Their finest art, their best
    constructive skill, and the patient labour of long years, were lavished
    upon these buildings which thickly stud the country. Thoroughness and
    devotion are written large on the orientated, massive, and grandly
    sweeping walls of the Elliptical Temple at Great Zimbabwe. One cannot
    call their faith “vain” when one realises that it led them out from
    themselves towards something higher, while for them it must be
    remembered the True Light had not shined. Struggling though blindly to
    improve their relationship to Deity provided a no mean factor in the
    religious progress of the world.</p>

  <p>While these ancient Semitic colonisers of Rhodesia have slept their
    many-centuried sleep, what epochs of the world’s history have come
    and gone, and what empires have risen and decayed! Ah! see that
    lichen-mantled granite block low down in the cyclopean wall. It has a
    little chip of stone under one corner as if to steady it. The ancient
    mason was a careful worker. The chip is still there to-day. One can
    move it with a finger. Was it there when Moses led the Hebrews towards
    the Promised Land, or there when young Joseph was sold as a slave into
    Egypt? Who shall say? Civilisations have come and gone, but the chip is
    there, and affords not merely an evidence of the careful mason, but a
    sermon on the brevity of life, the utter smallness of pomp and power,
    and the absolute absurdity of pride. Still the little granite chip has
    served its purpose for some four thousand years, and it may yet be
    there occupying its humble position at the end of the next millennium.
    The oldest fanes of Europe, whether of Greece or Rome, cannot so
    deeply move to awe-inspiring feeling as can the massive walls of the
    temple at Zimbabwe, for these old empires are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span> believed to have been
    almost unborn when Zimbabwe was at its zenith. Thus the walls compel a
    listening to their sermons.</p>

  <p>As one strays through the Sacred Enclosure, thoughts come:—What were
    the relative positions of magic and religion, especially in the
    complicated and closely observed Phallic worship of these ancients;
    whence the zodiacal, astronomical, and geometrical knowledge of the
    builders; what of the touch of tragedy in their exodus or departure;
    the exact meaning of the granite, slate, and carved soapstone monoliths
    on the summits of the walls; the origin of the occupiers; was Rhodesia
    the Havilah of Genesis; did it provide the Solomonic gold; of the close
    kinship of these successful ancient gold-seekers from Yemen or Tyre and
    Sidon to the Hebrews of Palestine; and of their intimate connection in
    origin, language, and neighbourhood which Holy Writ abundantly declares
    existed from the ninth chapter of Genesis until Paul preached in
    Phœnicia?</p>

  <p>Gazing at the Sacred Tower, one thinks of the Tower of Siloam, and of
    the “high places” of Samaria, and of the times when even this form of
    worship became the state religion of Judah under Ahaziah; and sitting
    at the conjectured site of the ancient altar, where the writer has
    found in numbers the stone emblems of their faith, thoughts arise of
    the Bethel stones of the Hebrews, the Bethûl or “the dwelling-places
    of God” of the Phœnicians, and the Penuel or “Face of God” of the
    Midianites.</p>

  <p>The Law of Moses adapts the rules and customs and ideas and forms of
    worship of far greater antiquity than the Mosaic times. So the new
    faith of every age borrows from the old, and the mighty processions of
    civilisations and faiths which have encircled this earth from very far
    back beyond the days of Abraham go on their even course.</p>

  <p>But we must leave the temple and return to camp. There is still the
    great Zimbabwe owl sitting on his favourite bough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> near the “high
    place.” The six-foot python crawls in and out of the stones of the
    ancient altar. Brightly coloured lizards bask on the once consecrated
    walls. Blue jays, honey-birds, and doves here find a shelter. The
    trees, orchid-clad and lichen-festooned, throw a weird shadow over all.
    Possibly ancients are sleeping near.</p>

  <p>As one passes out through the entrance into the full glare of an
    African noontide, one feels as if one had just returned from the far
    distant mystic past to modern life, for a naked Makalanga waits there
    with the message that Sunday lunch was cooked and waiting.</p>

  <h3>MIDNIGHT IN AN ANCIENT TEMPLE</h3>

  <p>It was the night of the full moon
    nearest to Midsummer Day in the Southern Hemisphere, and towards
    midnight the large population of Makalanga round Zimbabwe would be
    celebrating the feast of the full moon with dancing, singing, and
    <i>doro</i> drinking. This was evidently a special feast, for its advent
    had been the theme of conversation among our labourers for the past
    fortnight, and, unlike the other feasts, it was held simultaneously in
    each kraal, and not at different kraals in turn on alternate occasions.</p>

  <p>At nine o’clock all was still and restful. There were no signs whatever
    of the forthcoming festivities. Passing through Baranazimba’s kraal,
    on the way to Havilah Camp at Zimbabwe, one found the population had
    retired to rest. At Mogabe’s kraal the only sign of active life was
    shown by the village dogs. The night was hot and close, and outside
    the huts natives were sleeping, each in his blanket. Arrived at
    Havilah Camp, one found a score of labourers, sublimely free from all
    anxieties, sleeping on the bare granite outside their huts, but so
    oppressive was the air that in their slumbers they had thrown off their
    blankets, and were lying in every conceivable posture, and snoring and
    talking in their sleep as if dancing and beer-drinking were matters
    that had not the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>slightest interest for them. The large full moon
    was yet some distance from its zenith, but the valleys were flooded
    with a greenish-grey mistiness, which lay over the high grass and
    ran up into the kloofs and gorges. The light made distant objects
    distinctly visible, throwing a mantle of romance over every clump,
    ridge, and kopje, while it was possible to read tolerably small print
    without the aid of artificial light.</p>

  </div>

  <p>For fully another hour the silence was unbroken. At last the desultory
    beating of a village drum at Mogabe’s kraal was heard. Later a drum
    was sounded at Chenga’s kraal, and another at Bingura’s kraal. The
    villagers were waking up for the feast. One of our labourers sat up,
    stretched himself and yawned, and commenced shaking his sleeping
    comrades. Within a few minutes Havilah Camp was all life. One native
    reached for his leggings of large nuts with dried kernels inside,
    others a horn, flute, piano, or harp, but all took two knobkerries,
    some having assegais. Those who possessed strings of wild-cat tails
    tied them round their waists. The early hours of evening had been
    devoted to greasing their bodies and limbs, and in the light of the
    moon their skins shone like burnished metal. Then began a general
    practising of dance steps, leapings, war-cries, and most hideous
    howlings. Meanwhile quite a dozen drums were being sounded up on
    Mogabe’s Kopje, and these were answered by similar numbers at Chenga’s
    and the other kraals. Horns were blown, parties of Makalanga, singing
    and shouting, were passing along the native tracks in front of our
    camp, each party going to its own kraal. Soon our labourers left
    in gangs for their respective villages and disappeared in the long
    mist-covered grass. Being all young men with a superabundant fund
    of spirits, they made a most fearful din in the course of their
    progress homewards. By this time the Zimbabwe kopjes resounded with
    singing, especially of girls’ singing, for the women-folk started the
    festivities with screams and yells, and the loud beatings in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> three-two
    time of innumerable drums. The great full moon was now fast approaching
    its zenith. Our camp, save for the watch-men, the <i>kya</i> (hut) boy, and
    the picaninni, once more became still and lifeless.</p>

  <p>Theodore Bent saw in these new and full-moon feasts some connection
    with the cult of Nature Worship of the ancient Semites, who are
    believed to have built these ruins and to have mined for gold in
    Southern Rhodesia, as it is conjectured, some three thousand years
    ago. The women, who at this moment are dancing in the villages,
    have on their bare stomachs, worked into the skin, a “breast and
    furrow pattern,” identical to that found on many of the oldest of
    the prehistoric relics discovered in our ancient ruins, an undoubted
    emblem, Bent contended, of the ancient conception of Fertility. The
    men who will be dancing have worked in their skins, mainly in bands
    round their waists, the three radiating bars, similar in form to the
    Welsh bardic emblem of the Origin of Life. The articles they will
    wield in their dancing are carved with chevron pattern, one of the
    most ancient of all emblems of Fertility. But although the flesh
    decorations are now merely luck signs, neither man nor woman would on
    any account be without them. With these signs they say they will not
    be sick, will have plenty of wives and boys to work for them, and many
    girls on account of whom to receive <i>lobola</i> (marriage present to the
    father—practically purchase money). Anon, in the pauses of the dance,
    they will drink beer from pots with herring-bone pattern encircling the
    lips, a beer made of red millet, prepared, says Bent, in the same way
    and known by the same name as the beer prepared in Arabia to-day, where
    its methods of preparation and its name have been handed down from
    immemorial age.</p>

  <p>But to-night will be the finest opportunity for the next twelve months
    of seeing the Elliptical Temple by moonlight. Sleep this hot, close
    night is impossible, especially with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span> sounds of noisy revelry
    proceeding simultaneously from all points of the compass. My native
    boy is disinclined to follow me to the temple, but after bargaining
    with him for an <i>Isi-hle</i> (present), he at last grudgingly consents.
    He mutters something about the place being bewitched, that there are
    many horrid things there, and alludes to the <i>M’uali</i>, the chief spirit
    of Makalanga awe and dread; but as within the two years’ residence at
    Zimbabwe I have only discovered two natives, and these elderly men, who
    would willingly go into any of the ruins, especially the temple, after
    darkness had settled down, I am not at all surprised at his reluctance
    to follow me there. However, he is mindful to take his stoutest
    knobkerries with him.</p>

  <p>Looking back at the Acropolis Hill, and at its long line of precipice,
    one sees the ancient walls on the summit gleaming white in the
    moonlight, while the tall monoliths stand clear against the sky. In
    the passages on the hill one might almost expect on such a night to
    come face to face with Rider Haggard’s She at any corner, or to see
    her draped form issuing from one of the numerous caves which still
    pierce the cliffs. But we must turn our backs on the Acropolis Hill,
    and make for the Elliptical Temple, passing the little graveyard
    where the remains of Major Alan Wilson and his Shangani heroes rest
    in their granite tomb in the grove of euphorbia trees, whose branches
    cast black, sharp-cut shadows on the ground. Then across an open
    granite space, and up the long parallel passage on the east side of
    Ridge Ruins, out through its intricate southern entrance, and on to
    the level ground which runs up to the foot of the temple walls. The
    clumps of tall, old-world-looking aloes and euphorbia trees lining the
    walls of No. 1 Ruins on the left of our path appear strange even by
    daylight, but in the midnight radiance of the full moon they assume
    intensely weird and fantastic forms thoroughly in harmony with the
    outlines of the ancient buildings. The lonely grave of Thomas Bailey,
    an Australian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> gold prospector, lies close to the right-hand side of
    the path. He died in 1893 while searching for relics within the temple.</p>

  <p>The temple walls covered with white lichen appear to have been
    whitewashed for centuries, and these gleam brightly with light in
    distinct contrast to the dark veld and bush from which they rise; and
    so white are they that at a fair distance one can see every course,
    block, and joint in their dry masonry. The broad bases of the walls
    in comparison with the widths of their summits—though a full-sized
    wagon and a team of sixteen oxen could stand upon the top of the more
    substantial portion of the walls—their sloping sides, and the utter
    absence of any feature of any style of architecture known in Western
    Europe, lend a strikingly Eastern appearance to the building, which is
    sufficient in itself to forcibly take one’s mind back some two or three
    thousand years. Meanwhile the noise of village drums, the blowing of
    horns, and the deep wild choruses of crowds of men, mingled with the
    voices of women and girls, were waxing louder and more incessant as
    midnight approached.</p>

  <p>Standing in No. 5 Enclosure, just within the west entrance, the
    interior of the temple is seen to be full of light and shadow. But all
    is serenely calm and still as if possessed by the silence of the grave.
    The high, massive walls encircling the temple deaden to faintness the
    voices of the villagers. The close air, heavy with the scent of verbena
    wafted in from the veld, is oppressive in the extreme. An inexplicable
    sensation of trespassing in forbidden precincts possesses one. The
    native looks scared. Midnight visits to ruins are not his particular
    fancy.</p>

  <p>Certainly the many visitors who travel hundreds, if not thousands, of
    miles to view these ruins, and who only see them by the glare of day,
    miss nine-tenths of the charm, fascination, and inspiration which the
    walls of the temple at Zimbabwe have in store for those who walk its
    courts in the stillness of the night when the midsummer moon is at the
    full.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> This is the time to see Zimbabwe aright, for Zimbabwe by day and
    Zimbabwe by night presents two entirely different aspects.</p>

  <p>Trees throw gigantic shadows on the walls and darken the inner
    courts, and the floors are chequered by moonbeams shining through
    the foliage overhead. One somehow becomes possessed with the idea
    that these walls are peopled with the spirits of prehistoric age,
    who are moving, as of old, about the temple floors and passages,
    still performing their ancient priestly offices. The movement of
    every shadow against the walls suggests the passing from point to
    point of some three-millenniumed spectral form, too engrossed in its
    sacred avocations to heed the mortal presence of two strangers of the
    twentieth century after Christ. Would that these hoary-aged walls could
    speak and tell us of the scenes which took place here when the Great
    Zimbabwe was in all its glory! Assuredly a midnight hour spent in this
    ancient temple overwhelms one with most novel sensations, some slightly
    queer and shivery, others awe-inspiring and soul-stirring.</p>

  <p>While still standing just inside the west entrance some thoughts
    suggest themselves. The ancients being Nature worshippers of one of
    the earliest cults, so says Bent, had sought in the erection of their
    temple to compel the concentration of thought on the heavens alone, for
    even the reduced heights of the summits of the walls, averaging from 22
    ft. to 31 ft., shut off, except for gaps, all views of the surrounding
    landscape. Nothing is visible save the moon and a skyful of silent,
    glittering stars. The Pleiades, by the rising and setting of which the
    Makalanga mark their sowing and harvesting, are sinking towards the
    W.N.W. horizon, and Orion, which is prominent in the star-pictures
    of the natives, is following down in their wake. A large area of the
    sky is hidden by the bright radiance of the full moon. But such high
    massive walls enclosing the temple, and limiting the view to the sky
    alone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span> strike the mind of the stranger unread in the lore of ancient
    Semitic faiths as the purposed design of the ancient architects,
    especially so when it is recollected that some of the ancient floors
    are at a much lower level than the interiors as seen to-day. And just
    as Britishers in Rhodesia unconsciously turn their gaze at night
    towards the stars which lie low near the northern horizon, so in the
    contracted view afforded by the temple walls we can well imagine that
    during their midnight vigils the eyes of the ancient colonists from
    the north would, as naturally, frequently and lingeringly glance over
    the northern wall to gaze on stars known to them in their Homeland. It
    may be noted, too, that the ancients, as conjectured by Bent and other
    writers, do not appear to have been greatly interested in the alien
    stars of the Southern Hemisphere, for in all the ruins in Rhodesia,
    so far as discoveries have been made, there are no massive stone arcs
    surmounted with monoliths with mural decorations of old-world emblems
    of fertility on their outer faces, and with the raised platforms
    approached by steps, facing towards the south, for all such that are
    known are directed to some other point of the compass.</p>

  <p>Small fragments of granite chips from ancient blocks lie about the
    floor, and these gleam like stars on the dark ground, and have
    light-haloes of their own. These suggest the splendid sight these
    ancient walls must have been when all the newly dressed granite
    blocks in the faces of the walls sparkled as they must once have done
    as the fragments gleamed in this glorious moonlight. The walls must
    have glittered like a fairy palace, as did the castle walls of lordly
    Camelot. To-day we approach the temple on the same level as the veld,
    the ground outside having been raised to this level by the silt of
    ages, but the recently discovered granite cement floors outside the
    building show that the ancients had to ascend some five feet or more
    to gain the threshold of the entrance. With such higher elevation for
    its walls,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span> the temple, when freshly built, or perhaps for centuries
    afterwards, must have been on moonlit nights a most bewitching sight of
    splendour. But its glories to-night are those which it has gained from
    the hand of Time.</p>

  <p>But on gaining the central area of the building the inexplicable
    sensations awakened by the weird and strange surroundings and past
    associations are intensified, and one’s nerves are forced to be more
    alive to anything unusual happening. Large bats and night-moths fly
    unpleasantly close to one’s face. Treading on a rotten stick, and the
    falling of large dry leaves which rattle on the stones below, make
    noises sufficient to cause one to turn round expecting the approach
    of some ancient spectre. A frog in some dark and dank corner startles
    one with a loud croak of “<em>Work!</em>” The hoot of an owl makes the native
    start. A low moaning, soughing wind now springing up sweeps round the
    temple and rustles in the upper branches of the trees.</p>

  <p>The temple is now lovely in the extreme. The shadows on the walls are
    now in quick movement. Fireflies swing their tiny lamps over dark
    enclosures. The white radiance of the moonlight completely invests the
    conical tower, its intense whiteness being heightened by the large,
    thick, and dark-foliaged trees on either side. If but Time’s hour-glass
    were turned back for some long centuries’ space, what tales could not
    this tower unfold, what secrets of ancient faiths disclose!</p>

  <p>One passes down the ancient stairs, lately uncovered, which lead into
    the Sacred Enclosure, and finds the long, deep-sunk Parallel Passage
    wrapt in sepulchral darkness, and realises the force of the dark lore
    of ancient priestcraft and of prayers muttered at midnight. It is
    pleasant to regain the interior of the temple, where broad streams
    of moonlight flood its surface. Seated on the east wall of No. 10
    Enclosure, and immediately facing the conical tower, one has a good
    view all round the temple. Under the dark shades<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> of walls and trees
    a hundred spectres might be lurking unseen. Amidst such surroundings
    a score of ancient scenes are pictured in one’s mind—the approaching
    priests with processional chant emerging through the north entrance
    from the Sacred Enclosure, the salutation to the emblems of the gods,
    the light of altar fire and torch reflected upon the walls and upon
    the sacred golden fillets bound round the brows of the priest, the
    incense-laden air, the subdued murmurings of the waiting crowd of
    worshippers, the invocations of the deity by priests who stand upon the
    high raised platform in front of the conical tower, the mystic rites,
    dark enchantments, and the pious orgies. The very air feels as if it
    were teeming with mystery and midnight loneliness. Here appear to rise
    “<em>the thin throng of ghosts ... with beckoning hands and noiseless feet
    flitting from shade to shade</em>.”</p>

  <p>The rising wind now wafts into the ancient shrine the confused
    shouting, singing, tom-tom beating, and general clamour of the natives
    dancing in the villages on the hills around. The air has become
    decidedly cooler. One is glad to have visited the temple at this hour.
    It is one of the experiences of a lifetime.</p>

  <h3>THE ACROPOLIS AT SUNSET</h3>

  <p>In the soft sunlight of a glorious late
    afternoon, when calm broods over all and a profound solitude invests
    the immense panorama of valley, mountain, and sea of jagged kopje
    ranges as beheld from the summit of the Acropolis Hill some 300 ft. at
    least above the Zimbabwe Valley, one views a scene of indescribable
    loveliness. The sharp-cut ranges of hills, deep gorges flanked by
    cliffs, great crags of rock, and the long and broad Moshagashi Valley
    with its scattered kraals and patches of native plantations are all as
    silent as sleep.</p>

  <p>The Acropolis itself is still. The long and labyrinthine passages give
    back no echoes. The temple courts are empty. The tall monoliths, like
    ghostly sentinels, point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> upwards to the sky, and the sunlight is fast
    fading on the ancient dentelle pattern at the Western Temple. These
    massive ruins, once teeming with a dense and busy population of Semitic
    colonists of prehistoric times, with their innumerable evidences of
    Phallic worship and extensive gold-smelting operations, are as quiet as
    the grave. The cry of a baboon, or scream of an eagle returning to its
    eyrie high up on the cliffs above the Eastern Temple, alone break the
    impressive silence enfolding one of the greatest archæological wonders
    of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

  <p>At this height and on a hill so isolated from its neighbours, and
    just at sunset when shadows are already gathering in the deep defiles
    in the cliffs upon its summit, an inexpressible sensation of intense
    loneliness and solitude asserts itself. No other human foot will tread
    these ancient approaches to the Acropolis till the sun has risen once
    again. There is no white man round about for miles, and the natives
    will not venture near the ruins after sunset. Two hours ago the herd
    was mindful to drive the goats from the high points on the face of
    the hill down into the valley. The natives will solemnly inform the
    stranger that as night approaches the spirits of their departed
    ancestors buried in the caves of the hill awaken, that the ruins are
    then bewitched. It may be easily understood that in minds made craven
    with centuries of slavery to a succession of invaders, and haunted,
    till the last decade, with constant dread of Swazi and Matabele raids,
    the standard of Makalanga valour is low indeed, and that at nights they
    shun these scenes of ancient life is not in the least surprising.</p>

  <p>Ascending the hill through the sunless Rock Passage, the air is cool
    and draughty, but on emerging at the upper end one is faced by the rich
    blinding glow of the setting sun, and here the air is still warm. As
    we pass through the Western Enclosure and through the gap in the main
    west wall of the Western Temple, a view down the sheer drop of the
    hill into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> the valley below presents itself. The Elliptical Temple is
    just losing its last faint touches of the golden tint of sunset. The
    “Valley of Ruins” is already in shadow, and its chaos of walls looks
    now even more chaotic and bewildering than it did in the full light of
    day. Mogabe’s cattle wending their way up Makuma Kopje to the kraal for
    the night, the bleating of sheep and goats already penned, the far-away
    talk of women and girls returning from collecting firewood with their
    bundles on their heads, and the laughter of small parties of natives
    returning homewards from their plantations, all speak of departing
    day. The lofty lichened sides of Lumbo Rocks are still bright orange
    in the sunset, but the nearer side of the Bentberg has become dark and
    black in shadow, showing up the walls of the Elliptical Temple in the
    foreground with striking clearness. The long ravine of Schlichter Gorge
    is now blurred in grey distances, while the Motelekwe and Mowishawasha
    valleys have already lost the sun for some minutes. The kopjes cast the
    same backgammon-board-shaped shadows across the valleys just as they
    did three and four thousand years ago when the tired ancients watched
    the drawing-in of day.</p>

  <p>But turning a glance round to the Western Temple, still at this height
    bathed in golden sheen, one sees only the ancient walls and passages
    silent and deserted. This area might have been a busy spot for the
    ancient occupiers at this hour of the day, for monoliths, decorative
    mural patterns, and conical towers are now all aglow with sunset
    brightness, and here at this time of day, as the shadow of the slanting
    granite beam fades on the dentelle pattern on the platform, they might
    have read as on a dial face, in light and shade, the progress of
    the season of the year. The call to prayers and the chanting of the
    evening hymn of the devout at sunset might at this same hour very many
    centuries ago have rung round the selfsame hallowed walls which look
    down sphinx-like and blankly upon the modern visitor.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

  <p>It is easy to fashion a tale of ancient scenes in such a spot and ’mid
    such surroundings. Such a scene may have been—the parties of ancient
    worshippers approaching the temple up the Higher Parapet or by the
    sunken passage in the Platform Enclosure, or along the East Passage,
    filling the amphitheatre and watching the bringing of the sacred
    vessels possibly from the now dank and evil-smelling Platform Cave to
    some spot near the centre of the temple, perchance at the centre of the
    arc of the great curved wall, which is directed towards the setting
    sun; the disappearance of the priests through the Covered Passage and
    their reappearance on the Platform, which faces west and overlooks
    the interior of the temple, or listening to priestly orations, the
    announcement of the actual sunset to the worshippers. Possibly, too,
    the chief priest may have announced the commencement of the “Feast of
    the New Moon.”</p>

  <p>At this moment the “boys” in Havilah Camp are yelling and dancing most
    frantically. Something unusual must have happened to cause the sudden
    outbreak of unearthly din. Right in the dazzling glow of the sun, and
    low down in the sky, and barely discernible by the eye of white men,
    is the slender silver scimitar of the young moon. A noisy night of
    beer-drinking, dancing and singing, and tom-tom beating will follow.</p>

  <p>But the dank smell of decay has now usurped the place of the
    sweet-smelling incense of the ancient ritual. The monoliths still point
    upwards, but who to-day can explain their plan and purpose, or read the
    silent intimations their shadows were wont to convey?</p>

  <p>The associations of the ruins of the Hill Fortress lie even more with
    the ancient military occupiers than with those of priests and worship.
    Traverses, buttresses, screen walls, intricate entrances, narrow and
    sunken passages, rampart walls, banquettes, parapets, and all other
    devices of a people conversant with military engineering and defence,
    are in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> great evidence all over the hill. These in their ingenuity,
    massive character, and persistent repetition at every point of vantage,
    baffle and astonish the best experts of modern military engineering
    science. The ancients were military strategists, and the Acropolis a
    stronghold, and its most prominent feature was defence.</p>

  <p>At this sunset hour no companies of ancient soldiery descend from
    the fort (East Ruins), at the foot of the Ancient Ascent, to relieve
    guard and take up their night watches on the wall barriers. In the
    now dim and scanty twilight one can wander at will through the two
    hill temples, the residential quarters, and into the caves which once
    might have held the gold stores of this part of the country. There is
    no officer on duty to challenge one’s approach. The sentry recesses
    in the narrow passages and at the entrances appear singularly empty.
    Fate finally came to relieve guard many centuries past, eventually
    permitting some semi-civilised Abantu people, such as the Makalanga, or
    “People of the Sun,” to desecrate the ancient temple floors with their
    copper and iron furnaces and bone and ash débris heaps. But the lively
    bustling crowds of ancients and of mediæval Makalanga, who both in
    turn, and for very long periods, densely populated Zimbabwe Hill, are
    no more.</p>

  <p>One passes along shoulder-wide and tortuous passages, where at every
    corner one might expect to come face to face with Rider Haggard’s She,
    and enters some enclosure whose sides are formed by the perpendicular
    flanks of cliffs and boulders, where the ancients fashioned their gold
    into beads, wire, plates, and ingots. The intricate entrance still
    guards the spot where gold crucibles, beaten gold, and gold burnishing
    tools of the ancient artificers have been found in profusion. There is
    now no sound of hammering the precious metal on the rounded dolorite
    anvils, nor reddish glow of light on the cliff sides, as when the
    furnace was uncovered for the removal of the heated crucibles. The
    prehistoric work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>shop is now desolate and damp, and a fitting spot for
    the loathsome, crawling creatures which inhabit its dark recesses.</p>

  <p>But daylight is dying fast. Glancing down through the gaps in the outer
    walls are seen specks of firelight at near and remote kraals where the
    evening meal is being prepared, and round which the advent of the new
    moon will soon be celebrated. An adjoining cave with yawning depth
    and dense blackness does not now appear particularly inviting to the
    visitor, and yet here relic-seekers unanimously declare was where the
    ancients kept large stores of gold dust. The Eastern Temple is in
    semi-darkness, but as one crosses its floor one sees the hole from
    which some fifty phalli were taken, and the exact spots from which
    soapstone birds were removed. Here was the site, as Bent conjectured,
    of the ancient altar. In this temple, it is believed, the ancients
    celebrated their daybreak ritual, for the arc of the main wall
    decorated with dentelle pattern, and on which once stood some of the
    soapstone birds, faces the rising of the sun. Passing along Central
    Passage, which is perpetually in shadow owing to huge tall boulders
    on either side, but is now in deepest blackness, crossing Cleft Rock
    Enclosure, and descending the sunken passage to the outer face of the
    great west wall of the Western Temple, one arrives where a slight
    afterglow of the sunset still lingers over the brow of Rusivanga.</p>

  <p>Again one enters into the deep shadow of a sunken and earth-smelling
    passage with high side walls, and so rapidly descends the north-west
    face of the hill, glad to emerge once more into the cool fresh air
    at a lower level of some 100 ft. High in the west is Venus, the
    evening star, shining brightly—Venus, or <i>Almaq</i>, “illuminating,”
    the goddess of the earlier star-worshipping Sabæans of Yemen, whose
    worship the best-qualified scientists believe was practised by the
    original builders of Zimbabwe. She complacently shines down upon her
    ruined shrines, and wonders doubtless why these natives should convert
    the sacred emblems of her worship into pipe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>-bowls for smoking hemp.
    The Pleiades have set, for the harvest time is almost over. Orion is
    sinking towards the western horizon as if with disgust at the land
    where mere Kafirs<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> call him “The little pig and two dogs.”</p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III<br /><br />
      <span class="small">A DAY AT HAVILAH CAMP, ZIMBABWE</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">EARLY to bed, our Makalanga labourers are proportionately early to
    rise, and as soon as there is sufficient light to enable them to see
    they are up, stretching their limbs, waking the echoes of the valley
    with their noisy yawnings, which jar on the lilt of the dawn-anthems of
    the birds, and sit crouching round fires with their blankets over their
    shoulders.</p>

  <p>The sun will soon be coming up behind the blue Beroma Range, just
    over the romantically shaped rocks at Chenga’s kraal. The peaks of
    the range are already edged with the fire of the coming light. At
    last a notched portion of the sun appears over the distant mountain
    heights. Now everything is coloured crimson. The granite cliffs and
    massive boulders, the tall grass, the ruined walls, even the mules
    outspanned in the valley in front of the camp, are all crimson. The
    usually dirty-coloured grass roofs of the huts are for some minutes
    most gorgeously beautified. For the only time in the day the dentelle
    pattern on the conical tower and on the eastern face of the Eastern
    Temple, the chevron pattern on the Elliptical Temple, and the huge
    herring-bone pattern on the ancient water gate, and certain of the
    slate and granite monoliths, are fully bathed in rich sunshine. Other
    ancient decorative patterns on the walls will have the full sun shining
    upon them only at midday, while others will only be fully sun-bathed as
    the sun is setting.</p>

  <p>But at present everything is crimson. The wreaths of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> mist which lie
    over the tall grass filling the valleys, and which just before were
    blue, now connect kopje and kopje, making the Acropolis and other
    summits crimson isles rising from out a crimson sea. The only objects
    that decline to take on the prevailing tint are some old-world-looking
    trees with green, metallic leaves. Were the picture of Zimbabwe with
    this misty colouring resting over it reproduced on canvas the artist
    would at once be condemned as extravagant. But Nature has more than one
    colour on her palette. The crimson melts in a rich golden hue which
    succeeds it. The cliffs, grass hut-roofs, and mist-wreaths become
    golden. The mules are transformed to gold, and the battered old wagon
    looks for once quite respectable with its golden buck-sail. But the
    gold in its turn also fades, the mist-veils lift and melt away, and
    the land once more regains its wonted tawny, sun-bathed appearance so
    suggestive of lions.</p>

  <p>Day has not yet had a fair chance to become commonplace, but in
    Havilah Camp life is beginning to stir. Three naked boys have gone to
    the spring for water, others collect wood, clean the pots, and draw
    <i>rapoka</i> meal and salt from the stores, while a tall pillar of bright
    blue smoke ascends in the still air from the boys’ fire. From our
    height can be seen a score of native villages, each with its column of
    blue smoke.</p>

  <p>Two or three sit by the <i>Isafuba</i> game-holes, and of course
    disputations at once ensue. Others settle down to work of their own,
    such as grass-hat making, carving sticks with chevron patterns, drying
    tobacco leaves, crushing snuff, dressing skins, or performing the
    duties of barbers. The boys are most industrious when engaged upon
    their own work. Others are off to inspect their bird and game traps, of
    which they seem to have at least a hundred within a short distance from
    the camp, while the rest sit and watch whatever happens to be going on.</p>

  <p>Down the side of Makuma Kopje, where Mogabe’s kraal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> is situated, come
    young men in twos and threes, some of them with musical instruments,
    such as Makalanga pianos, a flute, and a one-stringed harp with gourd
    attached to increase the sound, and of course all are singing. These
    on descending Makuma disappear in the ten-foot grass which fills the
    valley till they are near the camp. Other young men come from Chenga’s
    kraal in the opposite direction two miles away. These latter are the
    boys to work. Our best workmen come from Chenga’s, for Mogabe’s men
    have not been improved by tips and favours from visitors to the ruins;
    besides, belonging to the kraal of the paramount and dynastic chief,
    they deem themselves to be somewhat superior to all direction or
    reprimand by white men. Though Mogabe’s people know “how to be happy
    though Makalanga,” Chenga’s people seem to be even more genuinely
    contented with their environment.</p>

  <p>By 7 a.m. the camp is in full life, and all the boys are present with
    at least a dozen brothers and followers. The trap-owners have returned
    with rats, small birds, and possibly a rock-rabbit. A boy is given a
    note to take to Victoria, seventeen miles distant. He places the letter
    and his pass in a cleft stick, holds it out in front of him, and is
    off. He will be back in camp an hour after sundown, perhaps bringing a
    load of 35 lbs. on his head. A thirty-four miles’ journey is preferred
    to a day’s work in the temple, so that there are always willing runners
    into Victoria. There are eggs, poultry, milk, honey, melons, pumpkins,
    rice, and sweet potatoes for sale or barter for salt, and these can
    always be obtained for half the original price asked for them.</p>

  <p>Then there are burns to be dressed, quinine to be administered, or
    a lung-sick boy to be dosed. The “Parade State of the Malingering
    Brigade” is carefully kept down to the lowest possible limit. One is
    amazed at the way the boys bear their injuries. A severe wound which
    would put an ordinary European on the sick list is to them a mere
    trifle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> and without flinching they will take a burning stick from
    the fire and rub it up and down inside a gaping flesh wound till the
    bleeding has ceased. Should any one of them meet with serious injury,
    the rest will laugh immensely as if it were a huge joke. In this
    respect they are very callous. Toothache, a cold, or a slight touch
    of fever renders them most pitiable objects. The soles of their feet
    resemble hides, and one or two large thorns which would completely lame
    a European is a matter almost too insignificant for them to notice.
    They think nothing of standing on hot burning embers while lighting
    their pipes at a fire. On cold nights they sleep near a fire and will
    roll into it, but they are such remarkably sound sleepers that it is
    not until the next morning they discover they have been burnt. How
    they manage to save their skins from thorn scratches is a mystery, for
    all day they are walking with naked bodies through bushes and thorn
    creepers. Yet their skins are beautifully smooth and glossy, and are
    always without the slightest scratch.</p>

  <p>But the pots of <i>rapoka</i> meal under the euphorbia trees are now being
    stirred, and each pot has its circle of men to whom dyspepsia appears
    to be utterly unknown. Sometimes the boys bring a sack of dried
    locusts. Locusts are esteemed as a dainty, and make an occasional
    change in the menu, or possibly small red beans, or monkey-nuts, or
    toasted mealie cobs are feasted upon. While the meal is being devoured
    one could hardly imagine there was a native within a mile. The
    stillness of skoff-times (meal-times) in camp serves the purposes of a
    well-regulated chronometer. Teeth-cleaning is their first business of
    the day. On rising from sleep and after each meal this is religiously
    performed. Each takes a mouthful of water and rubs his teeth vigorously
    with a forefinger, using what water is still remaining in his mouth
    to wet the skin of face, neck, breast, and hands, squirting it out
    in doles as required. To hurry them back to work before their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> teeth
    had been cleaned would cause them to regard the <i>Baba</i> with looks of
    genuine horror.</p>

  <p>At 7 a.m. the ganger, a man who has worked in the ruins for Bent,
    Willoughby, and Schlichter, comes to the hut door to report that the
    men are now ready to start work. Then follows the roll-call, each
    raising his hand and passing on one side to a separate group as his
    name is read out. A boy absent for two days on account of alleged
    sickness is reported to have gone to a distant kraal to attend a “beer
    dance” where he danced the whole night through. A fine is entered
    against him. Makalanga split on one another in a fashion which English
    schoolboys would never permit. Our fines are rarely enforced, but the
    mere entering them in the book has a most wholesome effect.</p>

  <p>One feature in the roll-call generally strikes visitors as interesting,
    that is, the rhythmic sound of the names of the boys. To an Englishman
    these names would appear to be more suitable for girls than for men.
    In fact, all the names of the men are pretty, so pretty that it
    seems inappropriate to apply them to great fellows like some of our
    labourers. But like their ideally graceful and poetic gestures, while
    pronouncing each other’s names they unconsciously manage to throw into
    the pronunciation a delicate softness, rhythm of intonation, and charm
    of expression that are rather fascinating to the European listener. An
    Englishman totally unacquainted with the local language, and wrongly
    pronouncing the names, could not rob them of their poetry.</p>

  <p>The roll completed, all set off in Indian file either to the Elliptical
    Temple or the Acropolis, singing in chorus in a Tyrolese style, one man
    giving the recitative, which is almost always of a purely extempore
    and local character. When once within the ruins, blankets are thrown
    off and the forty boys make, with a background of light-coloured,
    lichen-draped walls, a dark mass of humanity, for, save their
    insignificant aprons fastened with a bark string to their waists,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
    and their necklaces of blue beads and amulets, and brass bangles on
    arm and leg, they are practically naked, and the sun shines on their
    glossy chocolate-tinted skins as on burnished metal. The Makalanga have
    exceedingly strong social instincts, and prefer to work together in one
    mass even in a small area. To separate them into small gangs would mean
    little or no work done.</p>

  <p>On wet days, or for a few succeeding days, the work is confined to
    carrying out blocks, which have either fallen from the walls or been
    piled up by the long succession of archæologists and gold relic
    collectors who have worked within the ruins. These are carried held
    up high over their shoulders at arms’ length, or else on the tops of
    their heads, where natives carry anything from the size of a pill-box
    to a 40 lb. load. They never carry anything with arms downwards. In
    fine weather, leaf mould full of roots and seeds, and past excavators’
    soil-heaps are removed outside in boxes, the narrow entrances
    precluding the general use of wheelbarrows. Relics would be lost in the
    wet and clayey soil were it removed in wet weather. All the boys work
    <i>en masse</i>, each picks up his box or block, and when all are loaded up
    they start in one unbroken line for the débris heap outside, singing
    choruses with recitatives all the way out and on their return. The
    boxes are carried on one shoulder, a knobkerrie being used as a lever
    over the other shoulder to hold up the back of the box. The procession
    of boxes seems interminable—“Milkmaid,” “Armour Beef,” “Lime Juice
    Cordial,” “Highland Whisky,” “Raisins,” “Coleman’s,” “Mazawattee,”
    supplemented by buckets, but above all by “Nectar Tea.” Each box has a
    branded notice uncomplimentary to ships’ boilers. But “Nectar” is the
    great triumph of Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p>It is a huge box, carried on two short poles, with “Nectar Tea”
    emblazoned on its sides in blue and white. It courtsies and bobs
    its way to and fro in a most stately fashion, and after it has left
    the pile which is being removed, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>a great reduction in the débris
    remaining can be noticed. The boys have no particular affection for
    this omnibus. They are believed to <i>bulala</i> (knock about) this box on
    purpose to ruin it, for several times a day they will bring it with no
    sorrow on their faces with the information that the box is <i>meningi
    gura</i> (plenty sick), each time fatally <i>gura</i>, but a few nails cure it
    of its injuries. Long may “Nectar Tea,” in the interests of archæology,
    continue to courtesy and bob its way through the western portal of the
    Elliptical Temple.</p>

  <p>The boys when working well will in a day do about as much work as a
    quarter of the same number of English labourers. They are inclined to
    be industrious when the <i>Baba</i> is in sight, but they immediately drop
    down on their haunches with knees up the moment his back is turned.
    This is a moral certainty. Then singing ceases, for when working they
    are always singing. Any excuse for a passing diversion is immediately
    seized upon. On the shout of <i>inyoga</i> (snake) they drop their tools at
    once, seize their knobkerries and jump into the jungle heedless for the
    time being of thorns and creepers. In respect of snakes they are not
    cowards. Inside the bush a perfect pandemonium is going on which never
    ceases till either the snake, generally a python or a black mamba, has
    been slain or has escaped into some pile of ancient blocks.</p>

  <p>Another day, after a brief absence from the temple, I found about forty
    women and girls from Mogabe’s kraal had arrived in the temple to watch
    their sons, brothers, and sweethearts at work. This they frequently do.
    The boys on this occasion, believing <i>Baba</i> to be further off than he
    really was, were chasing the dusky Cleopatras up and down the parallel
    passages, in and out of the enclosures, and dodging them round the
    base of the Sacred Cone. One burly Junoesque, bead-and-bangle-bedecked
    mother was having a most delirious and frantic ride round the temple
    courts in our only wheelbarrow, which is an iron one. As the barrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
    bumped along at full tilt against the stones it would each time
    shake her up terribly. The shrieking, screaming, and laughter of the
    girls and the yelling of the boys made the temple ring with a noise
    sufficient to make the priests of the ancient Phallic cult whirl in
    their graves with horror. But—<i>Baba!</i> and in thirty seconds the boys
    were all hard at work with most pious looks on their faces, and singing
    a well-known mission hymn. These great, fine-grown, frank-looking
    fellows, with their enviable ivories and provokingly pleasant smiles,
    are far worse than little children to manage. Their characters are
    perfectly riddled with frivolity, and their minds astonishingly
    mercurial. Every incident they notice is to them humorous, even the
    preservation work at the ruins is regarded by them as a sheer waste
    of time. Not one of them if he tried hard could keep silence for two
    minutes together. He must either talk, laugh, sing, whistle, or perform
    some absurd antic. Their utter guilelessness and naïve simplicity are
    in many respects both surprising and entertaining. To blame them before
    their fellows kills what little spirit they possess for work, while
    praise, even though barely merited, will cause them to redouble their
    efforts. To be in the slightest degree friendly or familiar with them
    is to completely destroy one’s influence over them; the granting them
    any favour is regarded by them as an undoubted sign of the donor’s
    weakness, and of the virtue of gratitude they are absolutely destitute.</p>

  <p>One wonders at the dual character which each possesses. In some
    respects a Makalanga is more moral than many a European, while in
    others the depth of his immorality cannot be plumbed. In some matters
    they are as pure-minded as Adam and Eve in the Garden, and know not
    that they are naked. In their hands their women’s virtue is safe. But
    contact with the “educated native,” especially a Cape Kafir, before
    their minds are prepared to receive even the most elementary education,
    works on them untold mischief.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

  <p>But the boys may be divided into two classes, one industrious and
    honest, the other lazy and thieving. These diverse characteristics
    appear to run in separate families. M’Komo stole Mrs. Theodore Bent’s
    honey. Three of his nephews in my employ stole meat, sugar, tobacco,
    or anything else in the <i>kya</i> (hut) they took a fancy to. Another
    nephew proved to be a veritable Iago in a <i>moocha</i> (a small leathern
    apron worn by men), and was always making mischief, not only among the
    boys, but also between the boys and the <i>Baba</i>. Of course these members
    of this family, notwithstanding its exalted connections, were warned
    off the camp, and are not allowed to be seen visiting it. Brothers of
    unsatisfactory boys are never taken on the works, but should there be
    any vacancy at the end of a month, and the supply of labour is greater
    than our demand, the places are offered to the brothers of trustworthy
    boys, and these always prove a great success.</p>

  <p>But to return to the Temple. About eleven o’clock the <i>kya</i> boy arrives
    with half a dozen wee picaninnies carrying kettle, tea-pot, etc. The
    <i>kya</i> boy comes in for an amount of chaff from the gang. They call
    him a “Moccaranga shentilman,” because, for two hours in the morning
    and for the same time in the afternoon, he can <i>lala</i> (rest), seeing
    that he starts work at 5.30 a.m. and is not free till about 8 p.m.
    Further, he has perquisites in the shape of meat, tobacco, and tips
    from visitors, and also in a diluted form acts as a sort of <i>baas</i>
    (master). But the <i>kya</i> boy takes all the chaff in good part, and gives
    back quite as much as he receives. The picaninnies, armed with bows and
    arrows, indulge in target practice, and make it ruinous to stick up
    lunch biscuits at forty paces.</p>

  <p>Probably Mogabe with his headmen will arrive to watch the boys working,
    and then I know what to expect. It is bound to come. After a long
    silence he remarks that he is glad to see the <i>Baba</i>. Another long
    silence, and then—“A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> <i>Baba</i> always gives presents to his children.” I
    assume a complete indifference to his remark. Mogabe is diplomatic, but
    his diplomacy is very thin. After a long pause he observes—“The <i>Baba</i>
    will make me a present of money.” I inform him I have none to give.
    Another long pause ensues, then, pointing to a hatchet, he remarks—“The
    <i>Baba</i> will give me this.” I explain that the hatchet is the property
    of the Chartered Company, and not mine to bestow. He fails to see the
    point of my statement, and bluntly says so. He pauses to consider what
    else he can ask for, and after a long cogitation says “Salt, <i>Baba</i>.”
    At last Mogabe is reasonable, and I instruct the <i>kya</i> boy to fetch him
    half a cup of salt. Mogabe is profuse in his thanks, and his speech is
    floreated with eulogies of the <i>Baba</i>.</p>

  <p>Now my turn begins. Mogabe and the elders of his headmen have a sixty
    years’ knowledge of the ruins, and he is acquainted with everything
    that took place at Zimbabwe during the time of Chipfuno his brother,
    who was the previous Zimbabwe chief. Pointing to a gap in an obviously
    ancient wall which had been rudely filled in with blocks, I ask him
    who filled up the gap. After a long consultation with his headmen, he
    says that the Makalanga did it to keep in the cattle, for this part of
    the temple was used as a cattle kraal, and that was when Chipfuno was
    a young man. Another gap was filled up when Chipfuno was a young man.
    I then hand him over some pieces of pottery with geometrical patterns
    not at all crudely executed, which we have just unearthed, and ask
    him if the Makalanga made them. For ten minutes he and his headmen
    are closely examining the pottery, noting the quality of the clay,
    the correctness of the pattern, and the glaze on both sides. Yes, the
    Makalanga made it, but not the Makalanga who are now alive, nor their
    fathers’ fathers. The pottery was of Makalanga make, but <i>meningi dara</i>
    (very old). The assertion he emphasises by gesture, manifestly meaning
    a great age.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span> Mogabe thus confirms the expert opinion of antiquarians
    that this class of pottery was made by the mediæval Makalanga. Mogabe
    comes to see us at every place we work at, and his opinion on “finds”
    belonging to recent generations of Makalanga may be taken, so old hands
    affirm, as perfectly reliable. The information so obtained is valuable
    both as to later walls and to articles found.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the chiefs Baranazimba or Chenga arrive at the ruins, and an
    <i>indaba</i> (conference) as to “finds” and built-up entrances always takes
    place, but the weekly <i>indaba</i> with Mogabe always commences with the
    same old rigmarole. It is a sheer waste of time to discuss anything
    ancient with them, for since the new jail at Victoria has been built
    they all solemnly declare that the <i>marungu</i><a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> (white men) built
    the ruins for a “Tronk!” All their old poetic explanations as to the
    presence of the ruins, such as they were built “when stones were soft”
    or “when days were dark,” have now gone to the winds. The ruins were
    prisons!</p>

  <p>But the <i>kya</i> boy has arrived with the salt, and Mogabe is happy. He
    wraps the salt up in the corner of his blanket, and is off to his kraal
    at once. When any <i>marungu</i> arrives in a Cape-cart at the camp Mogabe
    is down the side of his kopje a few minutes afterwards, and arrives
    there also. It is the same old story, only then the visitor is given
    <em>his</em> opportunity of demonstrating his liberality. “I am glad to see
    the <i>Baba</i>. A <i>Baba</i> always gives presents to his children.” Mogabe,
    like his fellows all over South Africa, is a born beggar, and yet he
    possesses seventy head of cattle, is rich in wives, grain, and labour,
    rules over a large area of country, receives a monthly allowance
    from the Government as chief, and a further allowance for warning
    unauthorised prospectors for ancient relics from the ruins.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

  <p>Mogabe’s day has gone. Still, notwithstanding his true Kafir fawning
    nature, there is something about the aged chief one cannot help
    respecting. He is intelligent, and he looks it, and his face, if
    white, would be taken for that of an educated European, for, like most
    Makalanga, he has little or nothing negroid in his features. Before
    the advent of the Chartered Company he was constantly at war with
    his neighbours, sacking villages, kidnapping women and children, and
    generally murdering. His last fight was in November, 1892, when he
    engaged the Amangwa people, the battle taking place just outside the
    western wall of the Elliptical Temple. His own people seem to somewhat
    neglect him, except in some tribal arrangements and in affairs in which
    he represents the Native Department. Formerly it was the rule that he
    ate first and his people afterwards; now he comes into our camp at
    skoff-times and asks the boys for some of their <i>rapoko</i>, porridge,
    and if they should happen to be mindful of his presence they will pass
    him a handful, but sometimes he sits there unheeded. He has now sold,
    perhaps for a mere song, the famous necklace of Venetian beads which
    Bent failed to induce him to part with. But there is a look in his eyes
    that gives one the impression that the old man does not at all relish
    the benefits of civilisation, and that he is pining for a return of the
    good old days of blood-shedding.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Mogabe’s biography would be worth
    writing.</p>

  <p>But Mogabe is in my good books, for he gave me permission to move some
    Makalanga graves made in certain of the passages on the Acropolis. Bent
    merely told Chipfuno that he was going to move the selfsame graves,
    and he at once withdrew all the labourers, and this not only caused
    Bent considerable difficulty, but he was not afterwards allowed to
    open the passages. Twelve years later Mogabe gives his consent on the
    understanding that he is given half <span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>a cup of salt, that the remains
    were to be properly re-interred, and that the boys who did the work
    should be allowed to go to their kraals to purify themselves. This
    purification is no mere excuse, but is an actual cleansing of those
    engaged in this particular undertaking. The boys informed me that until
    they had washed they could not eat, and that their fellows would keep
    away from them. The bones were not touched by hand, but were moved with
    two sticks. Once I picked up a solid copper bangle, which must have
    come, judging by the presence of scattered human bones, from some grave
    disturbed years previously by some excavator for relics. The boys were
    genuinely horrified when I touched it, but more so when I put it on my
    wrist. They said I must take it off at once and wash myself, and this
    horror at what I had done possessed them for several days and was a
    constant theme of conversation.</p>

  <p><i>Tjiya!</i> (cease work!) is sounded, and the boys take up the cry, and
    spring like chased buck helter-skelter through the western entrance
    into the hot, sultry atmosphere, singing, laughing, yelling, and
    caterwauling, just like boys let out of school. The relentlessly
    broiling heat and glare of noontide make one long for the beautifully
    cool shade of the huts.</p>

  <p>Arrived at the camp, some of the boys lie at full length on the hot
    boulders and so take sun-baths, others resume their own carving
    or other work, some make music, or play with dollasses, or fence,
    while the majority gather round the various sets of game-holes and
    play <i>isafuba</i>, but there is a camp rule, found by experience to be
    necessary, that <i>isafuba</i> cannot be played until the cooks state that
    the pots have commenced to boil. So fascinating is this game that
    formerly we found the cooking operations often became neglected.</p>

  <p><i>Isafuba</i> is one of a group of games, the origin of which is explained
    on pages 79, 80 of <cite>The Ancient Ruins of Rhodesia</cite>. In our camp are
    several sets of game-holes; one set has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> four rows of sixteen holes
    each, and another two rows of twelve holes. This last is generally
    patronised by the picaninnies. Some of the <i>isafuba</i> games have
    different moves, numbers of holes and counters, and the games vary
    slightly in different districts.</p>

  <p>From two to five players sit on each side. Each of the partners on
    either side appears to have an equal right of moving the counters. The
    two lines of holes near each set of partners is not intruded upon by
    the counters of the opponents, but opponents clutch up the counters of
    the opposite side when such counters have no counter either in the hole
    behind or in front, and this snatching up of counters is governed by
    rules which in some moves closely resemble those of chess, while double
    counters in a hole are as influential as kings in draughts.</p>

  <p>Some of the moves strongly remind one of “fox and geese,” each side
    moving in turn, and later in the game, when the holes are full of
    counters, each side chases the other along parallel lines of holes to
    the end of the set. This chasing is a cause of great excitement, and
    is concluded in a perfect babel of shouting, each player as he moves a
    counter in the chase calling out <i>in-da!</i> and when the final hole is
    reached, <i>ga!</i></p>

  <p>Always while in camp there is a perpetual shouting of <i>in-da! in-da!
    in-da!</i> followed by the triumphant shout of <i>ga!</i> The subject of heated
    discussion during the game is as to the amount of cheating the other
    side has effected, and the tumult caused by the discussion of this
    topic, especially with an extraordinarily talkative people like the
    Makalangas, can only be but partially imagined. The perpetual <i>in-da!
    in-da! in-da!—ga!</i> trespasses into one’s dreamland. After a week of
    this never-ceasing <i>in-da!</i> the sets of holes were ordered to be
    removed to a more reasonable distance from the hut door; still, one
    cannot even now escape this perpetual and monotonous din. Yet in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
    their excited disputations they have never once got beyond mere words.
    The picaninnies sometimes join in at the larger sets, but a prompter
    always assists them.</p>

  <p>It is the custom for the losers, and not the victors, to record the
    state of the series of games. This is done by placing large stones,
    one for each game lost, on the side where the losers sit. The losers
    invariably have to provide the stones. When all the large stones within
    arm’s reach have been used up as records and the losers have to get
    up to fetch a stone, there is general laughter in the camp, even from
    those who are not immediately watching the game. The stakes are for
    “sisspences,” or for <i>doro</i> (native beer), but both winners and losers
    share alike. Towards the end of a month, when wages are becoming due,
    the game causes increased excitement, and plenty of <i>doro</i> is brewed by
    speculative villagers to meet the probable demands of the boys.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

  <p>The two most pernicious vices of the Makalanga are their inveterate
    love of <i>I’daha</i> (wild hemp) smoking, and of <i>doro</i> drinking.</p>

  <p>The former acts as opium, and incapacitates for work, dulls the
    intellect, destroys every atom of will-power, and tends, if persisted
    in, to shorten life. An <i>I’daha</i> smoker is readily known by the glazed
    look in his eyes, and by his miserable appearance. On our arrival here
    <i>I’daha</i> pipes were introduced into the camp, but they were very soon
    destroyed, and the smoking of <i>I’daha</i> is now an offence punishable
    by dismissal without <i>mali</i> (money). This rule has effected a great
    improvement in the general tone of the men and in their capacities for
    work. So injurious to brain and health is this vice that in some parts
    of South Africa <i>I’daha</i> smoking is prohibited under a penalty. One of
    the most distressing features of this practice is the painful fit of
    loud coughing which always follows the use of the pipe.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

  <p><i>Doro</i>, brewed from <i>rapoko</i> (a red millet), is drunk very extensively
    by the Makalanga in this district, seeing that this part of the country
    yields grain in such enormous quantities. But the natives do not regard
    <i>doro</i> as a mere beverage. At new and full moons, or at the rising or
    setting of the Pleiades, which determine the sowing and harvesting
    seasons, <i>doro</i> is provided by the native farmers in lieu of wages, and
    on these occasions it is drunk most extensively by people of all ages.
    The men delight in gulping it down in quantities with the avowed and
    deliberate intention of getting drunk as soon as possible. The state of
    stupefaction induced by <i>doro</i> is one of their most exquisite delights.
    On Saturday mornings the one topic of conversation of the gang is as to
    how much beer they will drink on <i>I’zhuba Kuru</i> (Sunday), how soon they
    will get drunk, and what they will do when they are drunk. On Mondays,
    in spite of their “large heads” and sodden appearance, discussions take
    place as to who were the most drunk. The one who lost most control of
    himself is considered a hero. In their opinion the man who was most
    intoxicated honours himself, and can afford to boast.</p>

  <p>Even those who are in many other respects the most hopeful young men
    equally delight in getting absolutely intoxicated. The lads from eight
    years of age imbibe <i>doro</i> most copiously, while boys of twelve get as
    drunk as their seniors. The brains of the natives are so small that the
    <i>doro</i> acts upon them speedily, and two hours’ drinking will undo all
    the benefit of two years’ contact with civilisation. Then all their
    innate savage nature reasserts itself in every violent form, and their
    swaggering insolence, inspired by <i>doro</i>, is intolerable. But the evils
    of <i>I’daha</i> smoking and <i>doro</i> drinking are not of modern origin,
    but are ingrained in their blood and bone by many past centuries of
    devotion to these practices.</p>

  <p>The rarefied air of these highlands conducts sound over long distances,
    and triangular conversations are constantly in progress between the
    villagers at Mogabe’s kraal, our boys <span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>at the camp, and those working
    on the Hill Ruins, though each point is at least a third of a mile
    distant from the others. These conversations are carried on without
    the slightest straining of the voice or even shouting, the secret
    apparently being the slight raising of the voice and speaking very
    distinctly and very slowly. From their vantage position on the hill
    the boys are always on the look-out for natives passing and repassing
    between the villages. While the passing natives are, as one would
    believe, outside the hearing limit a conversation with the boys has for
    some time been in progress. Our boys will give the usual salutation,
    and if this be replied to all well and good. But should it not be
    replied to, or not promptly, the boys will at once start in chorus to
    slang the passer-by and all his relatives, commencing with his mother.
    So long as the passer-by is within earshot, so long do these slanging
    matches continue. Each boy endeavours to cap each previous remark with
    something more pungent, and as he succeeds the rest cheer him. Natives
    state that the sound of their voices travels quickest and furthest in
    the early mornings.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The visits of <i>marungu</i> to the ruins are highly interesting occasions
    for the natives. The news of any approaching arrival is shouted down
    from Mogabe’s kraal a third of a mile away, for from Mogabe’s Kopje
    there is a four miles’ view of the road from Victoria. Long before the
    Cape-cart or horsemen can enter our valley from over the ridge between
    Rusivanga and Mogabe’s kopjes it is known where we are working, how
    many visitors are arriving, the description of vehicle, and if there
    is a lady in the party. Arrivals always attract a score or more naked
    picaninnies, who accompany the conveyance from the ridge at the foot
    of the Rusivanga down to the camp. But such visits are infrequent, and
    three weeks or a month pass without a white man arriving at Zimbabwe,
    and when, after such intervals, they do arrive, their faces look
    strange <em>because they are white</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> while the sound of the English
    language is strikingly odd. On some rare occasions as many as three
    camps of visitors have been fixed up on the outspan. A patrol of the
    British South Africa Police calls about once a month, and the troopers
    generally introduce themselves with some such salutation as “Well,
    still alive? Not murdered yet?”</p>

  <p>Humorous incidents are not absent in the work of excavation in the
    ruins. For instance, after working for some hours in a trench near
    the Sacred Enclosure, and passing all soil over boards and through
    fingers in the search for relics, a common clay pipe of English make
    was found intact at a depth of over 3 ft. At another spot, after hours
    of careful but unrewarded work in a trench, at a similar depth a very
    late brand of soda-water bottle was found. Both these finds delighted
    the boys infinitely more than had they unearthed a cartload of phalli
    or other prehistoric relics of value. In some respects the boys are
    extremely practical. The question “<i>aliquid novi ex Zimbabwe?</i>” can in
    two senses be answered in the affirmative. Such modern articles found
    “at depth” afford only another proof that the soil in the interior of
    the temple, as stated elsewhere, has been turned over and over again by
    archæologists, and also by unauthorised prospectors, for ancient gold
    and other relics.</p>

  <p>After <i>tjiya</i>, when the day’s work is done, there is still an hour or
    so of daylight left, and this is usually occupied in wandering among
    the kopjes or along sequestered valleys, keeping an eye open for fresh
    traces of the ancients, or in examining and measuring some one of
    the minor ruins which stud the valley, or in calling at a village to
    arrange for labour, or in looking out for buck and guinea-fowl for the
    pot.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the sun is setting in a gorgeous west, and the golden glow
    is already fading on the temple walls. Then come the shadows of night,
    and these settle down rapidly. By the time the hut is reached the <i>kya</i>
    boy has lit the candles, laid the table, and is ready with the skoff.
    The boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span> are sitting round their fire or finishing a game of <i>isafuba</i>
    in the semi-darkness. Their evening meal is being cooked. One of them
    has brought a gourd of <i>doro</i>, and another a pot of fat, in which each
    handful of porridge is dipped before being eaten.</p>

  <p>Sitting on the stoep of the hut at this time of the day is a perfect
    rest. The air is agreeably cooled by a light breeze, which is laden
    with the scent of verbena. The night is calm and peaceful. Large
    bats fly swallow-wise, fire flies dart in all directions, glow-worms
    shine steadily in the grass, and birds, frogs, and insects join in
    mild choruses. The call of a boy in our camp to some companion up on
    Mogabe’s Kopje is repeated half a dozen times by the precipices of
    Zimbabwe Hill, where the echoes die out in a series of sharp raps.
    The large full moon rises serenely from behind the trees on Beroma
    Range, and bathes the country in delicate soft light, imparting a
    greenish-grey tint to the mist-veils which fill the gorges, throwing
    a deeper suggestion of mystery and awe over the wide expanse of bush
    where the lion holds his court.</p>

  <p>The boys, having finished their meal, now indulge in post-prandial
    rhetoric, and dialectic ping-pong. The ruddy glow of the fire reddens
    the huts and shines on the naked bodies and limbs of the crowd, making
    them resemble polished ebony, while as their tall and well-proportioned
    figures with kingly walk pass and repass in the flickering lurid light
    they appear to resemble shades from across the Styx. Such a scene is
    at least Dantesque, and to many might seem weird. But the boys are
    as happy as their hearts can wish. Their joviality is irrepressible.
    Harmony from their instruments, rhythmic chants, peals of laughter,
    wild recitatives, constant talking, with perhaps a wrestling match and
    a war-dance executed in simulated form thrown in, fill up two hours,
    by the end of which they are all under their blankets, sleeping and
    snoring as only natives can.</p>

  <p>“Porridge,” the <i>kya</i> boy’s under-study, and eight years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span> old, has
    brought in the hut door, which also acts as drawing-board and stoep
    table, and has gone to the kitchen-hut, where he rolls himself up in
    his tiny blanket.</p>

  <p>An occasional bark of a baboon or wolf, or yelp of jackal, or hoot of
    owl, is heard in addition to the usual nightjar and frog choruses. The
    sounds of the village drums, and of singing and dancing at Mogabe’s
    or Chenga’s kraal, where the full-moon feast is being celebrated, are
    wafted down to us. The night is perfectly lovely, but for Havilah Camp
    the day is past and over.</p>

  <p>But the moon—itself a dead world—looks down upon the ruins of a dead
    city and on the graves of a forgotten race, as it has done ever since
    the stern policeman Fate ordered these ancients to “Pass on!”</p>

    </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="subheadj">Chipo-popo Falls—Frond Glen—Lumbo Rocks—“Morgenster”

      Hill—Chipadzi’s Kraal</div>

  <h3>CHIPO-POPO<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> FALLS</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap">THESE are about two miles and a half north-east of Zimbabwe, on the
    Motelekwe Road. The Chipo-popo, which is a perennial stream with its
    source on the south side of the Beroma Range, crosses the road and
    runs towards the Moshagashi River, which it joins four miles lower
    down. Immediately to the north of the drift (ford) the stream descends
    abruptly down granite ledges into a deep ravine, on the east side of
    which is Chipo-popo kraal. The falls are reached by leaving the road at
    thirty yards on the Zimbabwe side of the drift and going between some
    large boulders on the north side of the road. This is an interesting
    spot at any time, but especially so when rains have swollen the
    torrent. A path from Chipo-popo kraal leads to Oatlands Farm, four
    miles north-east of Zimbabwe, where Naidoo, an Indian, has an extensive
    market-garden. The walk to the falls and to Oatlands Farm is a very
    easy afternoon’s exercise.</p>

  <h3>FROND GLEN</h3>

  <p>This is a very pretty, secluded, and sheltered spot in a
    deep ravine about half a mile east of the South-East Ruins. A stream
    from the valley, which extends eastwards from the Elliptical Temple,
    passes through it in a south-easterly direction. On the banks of
    this ravine are to be found tree-ferns, palms, royal ferns (<i>osmunda
    regalis</i>), and maiden-hair ferns. The scenery and atmosphere of this
    glen <span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>are said to be somewhat similar to those of some tracts on the
    southern slopes of the Himalayas. To reach the glen one should leave
    the Motelekwe Road at three-quarters of a mile east of Havilah Camp,
    cross the small valley on the south to the South-East Ruins, and then
    go due east from the ruins, the land descending towards the glen.</p>

  <h3>LUMBO ROCKS</h3>

  <p>These strikingly picturesque cliffs, which form a
    prominent landmark for miles around, are a little over two miles
    south of the Elliptical Temple, and are approached by the native path
    leading from Zimbabwe to the Morgenster Mission. These granite crags
    rise perpendicularly for about a hundred feet from out of the summit
    of a rocky kopje, and form a rude square-sided column of precipice,
    which is divided into four portions by very narrow fissures, which run
    through it on all four sides from base to summit. Visitors should climb
    this hill and inspect the rocks. There are numerous granite boulders
    split into fantastic shapes all round this kopje. The headman, Lumbo,
    now has his kraal about a third of a mile to the west of these rocks.
    Chipadzi’s kraal lies one mile to the south-east of Lumbo Rocks, and
    half a mile nearer Zimbabwe, and on the west side of the path to the
    mission is the deserted kraal of Baranazimba, situate on a high rugged
    kopje among gigantic boulders which rendered the kraal most difficult
    of approach. This chief is a relative of Mogabe. His new kraal is on
    a kopje close to the Victoria-Zimbabwe Road about four miles from the
    ruins.</p>

  <h3>MORGENSTER (“MORNING STAR”) MISSION</h3>

  <p>One of the prettiest walks
    from Zimbabwe is to this mission station, which is barely three and
    a half miles distant in a south-south-westerly direction. The path
    passes between the <em>Elliptical Temple</em> and the <em>Bentberg</em>. About two
    miles along the path and close to the right-hand side is Baranazimba’s
    old kraal perched up high among the boulders of a kopje. The path
    then crosses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span> a nek between Baranazimba’s and the <em>Lumbo Rocks</em>, and
    descends into a narrow valley and up a high ridge, on which, cutting
    the sky-line, is a tall and prominent <em>Finger Rock</em>, which is only a
    few hundred yards from the mission, which lies just over the ridge.
    Morgenster is on a much higher elevation than the Zimbabwe Valley. The
    walk is highly interesting to anyone fond of romantic scenery. Rugged
    kopjes, with cliff-boulders on which huge granite masses are most
    delicately poised, lie along the right-hand side of the path for a
    great part of the distance to Morgenster.</p>

  <p>The mission was founded in 1891 by the Rev. A. A. Louw, of the Dutch
    Reformed Church, Dr. John Helm, the medical missionary, joining the
    station in 1894. Several other European missionaries are attached to
    the staff, and there are numerous outlying stations.</p>

  <p>The mission settlement is ideally situated on the south face of a
    high ridge overlooking the Mowishawasha Valley on the south and the
    N’Djena Valley and Motelekwe River on the south-east. Its position is
    marked by clumps of tall blue gum-trees. The buildings comprise the
    residence of Mr. Louw, the houses of Dr. Helm and other missionaries,
    and a school-house. Morgenster is celebrated for its banana plantation,
    the number of its lemon trees, and its large irrigated gardens. The
    Mahobohobo trees are very numerous in the vicinity of the station.</p>

  <p>The district in which the mission is situated is known to the natives
    as Amangwa, this being in former times the country of the once powerful
    tribe of Amangwa, who were driven away from the Zimbabwe district by
    the present local Makalanga on their arrival almost seventy years ago
    from the Sabi district. A kopje within a third of a mile on the east
    side of the mission was, until very recently, occupied by a local tribe
    of Makalanga, who built up rampart walls of unhewn stones to fortify
    the kopje against the attacks of the Matabele about 1893.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

  <p>Morgenster is also celebrated for the immense panoramic view of the
    Motelekwe Valley, extending for at least forty miles, where the
    tumbling sea of rugged kopje summits fades into the blue distance.
    The view is so extensive, impressive, and grand that one can never
    tire beholding it. As far as the eye can reach the land can be seen
    descending towards the south. The nearest point of the Motelekwe River
    to the mission is four miles. There are a great many villages in the
    valley.</p>

  <p>A peculiar interest attaches to this view of the Motelekwe Valley,
    for along it appears to have been the main route of the ancient
    gold-seekers from the coast to Zimbabwe, and so into the interior
    of the country. Along the Motelekwe is a chain of ruins (see
    <cite>Ancient Ruins of Rhodesia</cite>), of which the Mapaku Ruins, eight miles
    east-south-east of Zimbabwe, are the nearest. Some of these ruins
    are of major importance, and two at least are decorated with the
    chevron pattern, and occupy areas almost as large as the main ruins
    at Zimbabwe. This line of forts, or “blockhouses,” is extended along
    the Sabi River for a considerable distance into Portuguese territory.
    In viewing this valley from Morgenster, the thought that within sight
    lies one of the ancient roads to the coast, and that along it passed
    the gold- and ivory-laden caravans, makes the contemplation of the
    Motelekwe Valley one of absorbing interest.</p>

  <p>The sharp-cut kopje with steep glacis sides, about a mile and a half
    south of the mission, is Rugutsi. This divides the scenery of the
    Motelekwe from that of the Mowishawasha Valley on the south. This also
    is a fine view, but not so extensive as that of the Motelekwe Valley.
    An absolutely bare, granite, balloon-shaped kopje lies to the west.</p>

  <p>Two miles due south of the mission, in the Mowishawasha Valley, is a
    natural stronghold known as Wuwuli.</p>

  <h3>WUWULI</h3>

  <p>This village, which is two miles south of Mor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>genster, is
    situated in a deep and narrow ravine immediately west of the Rugutsi
    Kopje, which forms such a prominent feature in the landscape of the
    Mowishawasha Valley, as seen from the mission. Formerly this place was
    of considerable importance to the local Makalanga, for during the times
    of the Matabele raids the natives between this place and Zimbabwe took
    refuge in the very extensive caves which run under the north side of
    the ravine. A strong perennial stream flows through the caves. Here, in
    time of danger, women, cattle, and grain were hidden. When Mr. and Mrs.
    Bent visited this village, in 1891, the natives were opposed to their
    inspecting the caves, and they were only permitted to go a certain
    distance inside. Now that raidings have ceased the caves are deserted,
    save for bats, and we were permitted to view the caves without any
    demur on the part of the villagers.</p>

  <p>The present chief is Bungu, a brother of the present dynastic chief
    Mogabe by another mother. The former Mogabe, Chipfuno, resided at this
    kraal as well as at Zimbabwe, and it was here he was shot in 1892.</p>

  <p>When visiting this village we saw a man undergoing a cure by
    blood-letting. Incisions were made in the flesh of the leg, and horns
    of yearling cattle placed over them. The air was then sucked out of the
    horns through small holes in the top, and the holes were then stopped
    with wax. The horns clung to the flesh, owing to the vacuum which drew
    the blood. Bungu’s attention was drawn to an old iron-smelting furnace,
    on which was the usual female breast and furrow pattern. He said the
    natives did not smelt iron now because they could buy their garden hoes
    from the white men, and they were therefore saved the trouble of making
    them.</p>

  <h3>MOJEJÈJE, OR “MYSTIC BAR”</h3>

  <p>There are two of these mystic bars at
    Zimbabwe, one being on the Motelekwe Road, a quarter of a mile east
    from Havilah camp and opposite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> Middle Kopje (<em>Chamananga</em>), and the
    other about a mile from Zimbabwe, on the path to Bingura’s. The one
    on the Motelekwe Road is formed by a bar of aphite crossing a granite
    glacis, over which the road passes, but the one on Bingura’s Path is
    an arbitrary line drawn across a piece of granite, over which the path
    crosses. Each bar is at right angles to the path. At either end of
    each bar is a pile of stones, which show evident signs of having been
    hammered upon the bar for generations past. A native on a long journey,
    arriving at one of these bars, will take a stone from the pile on one
    side and with it tap the whole length of the bar, and lay the stone
    on the pile on the opposite side. Natives crossing the bar in passing
    between their kraals and their plantations, or going a short distance
    only, do not tap the bars. The idea in so tapping the bar is that by so
    doing the back is strengthened for the journey, and also that the man
    they are going to see may be at home, that the food will not be cooked
    till they arrive, and that their journey may be successful. There is no
    appeal to spirits or ancestors in performing this act.</p>

  <h3>SUKU DINGLE</h3>

  <p>This is situated but a few yards from the left-hand side
    of the lower path leading from Zimbabwe to Morgenster, and is about 400
    yds. north-east of <em>Lumbo Rocks</em>, about two miles from Zimbabwe. The
    dingle runs east and west, and is deeply wooded and narrow. This is
    a good spot for fern collectors. Down the dingle runs a happy little
    stream in perennial flow. The stream’s bed is formed of white clay. The
    sides of the banks have been trenched extensively for a perfectly white
    soil. This is used by the natives for whitewashing the outside of huts
    and for making the check patterns on their interior walls. It is quite
    possible that the ancients knew of this spot, and used the material in
    making their more choice pottery. The natives know of no other place in
    this district where the same <span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>material is obtainable, and they come
    from many miles’ distance to fetch it.</p>

  <h3>BINGURA’S<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> KRAAL</h3>

  <p>This kraal, which is situated two and a half
    miles west-south-west of Zimbabwe, is well worth a visit, the walk
    itself being interesting and the situation of the kraal romantic.
    Possessors of cameras will find at this kraal ample opportunities of
    making “shots” at native life, as well as of taking typical views of
    the Zimbabwe scenery. The path to Bingura’s crosses the valley lying
    between Havilah Camp and Rusivanga, and then leads up through native
    plantations to the broad nek on the horizon between Rusivanga and a
    kopje just west of the western end of the Bentberg. On the nek is
    another <i>Mojejèje</i>, or “Mystic Bar,” crossing the path, where it passes
    over open granite. The ascent to the nek is for almost a mile, and the
    path from the nek dips down the western side of the ridge into a wide
    valley, and passes through the farmstead of a Basuto mission-boy named
    “James.”</p>

  <p>The kopje on the summit of which Bingura’s kraal is located is of
    horse-shoe shape, and the huts of the kraal are along the line of
    summit at intervals among huge boulders. The almost inaccessible
    position this kraal occupies, and its rocky surroundings, is also
    paralleled by the now deserted kraal of Baranazimba, which is on the
    summit of a very high hill protected by precipitous cliffs, and lies on
    the right-hand side of the path leading from Zimbabwe to Morgenster.
    The men from this kraal, like those of Chenga’s, have not been spoilt
    by contact with white men as are many of the men of Mogabe’s kraal.
    So far Bingura has not yet left his natural stronghold, but the
    probability is that once the neighbouring fields become poor through
    over-cultivation he may, like his neighbours, move his kraal into the
    open country.</p>

  <p>Starting to ascend the hill, one hears at a hundred yards’ <span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>distance
    the noise of falling water in a ravine at the north foot of the hill.
    The path ascends steeply up fissures and along narrow ledges, and over
    slippery slopes of black granite worn white with the passing of many
    feet. Bingura’s hut is about half-way up the hill, and here on a small
    flat area are about a dozen huts, and on still higher ledges on the
    north and west faces of the hill are more dwellings almost hidden,
    even when near to them, among huge boulders, also many circular clay
    granaries perched on rocks out of the reach of white ants. The large
    number of these granaries testifies to the industry of Bingura’s
    people. The tree boughs were festooned with mealie cobs drying in the
    sun. A large, flat rock was covered with locusts, and quantities of
    melons, pumpkins, and gourds were laid outside the huts. Women were
    winnowing <i>rapoka</i> corn and cleaning rice. Bingura’s youngest wife,
    a fine and very good-looking young woman, was sewing pink beads in
    chevron pattern on to her skin apron, and every man, woman, and child
    appeared to have some occupation. There were more manifest signs of
    business here than at any other kraal in the district. Here they have
    less regard for the need of apparel than any of the inhabitants round
    about. Bingura is a small man of about fifty years of age, but as agile
    as a buck, and has a quick shrewd glance. This is in every respect the
    most interesting village in this district.</p>

  <h3>MOTUMI’S KRAAL</h3>

  <p>This kraal is about one mile west of Bingura’s, and
    is situate in open country and is worth visiting. Motumi is a very
    good specimen of a Barotse headman. He is fully seventy years of age,
    but is still hale, hearty, and straight. The features of the people at
    this kraal are very fine, and most of the men and boys are well-made.
    They are a very industrious people and never seem to be idling in their
    kraal. Motumi is above the average native in intelligence and can
    give an account of what is now Matabeleland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span> long before the Matabele
    arrived, with long lists of place-names in that country as then known.
    Matgwain, his eldest son, is exceptionally intelligent. Motumi’s people
    speak Chicaranga, and most of their characteristics and customs are
    also those of their neighbours, the Amangwa, to whom they are allied by
    long generations of marriages.</p>

  <h3>CHIBFUKO</h3>

  <p>This hill adjoins the Mowishawasha Hill, which is about
    seven miles west-south-west of Zimbabwe. <i>Washa</i> is always associated
    in the mind of the natives with power and authority. Chibfuko is never
    ascended by the natives. Either the hill itself, or something on it,
    causes them to revere or dread it. They never pass by without kneeling
    and clapping hands to it. It is said that they hear girls singing on
    its summit. The hill has a few caves highly suggestive in appearance of
    ancients and hidden relics. In this district valuable relics taken from
    the ruins have been discovered. Mr. Drew, Native Commissioner, is of
    opinion that many generations past some powerful Makalanga chief must
    have been buried on the hill and that this originated the native awe
    for the place, but the natives will not divulge the reason. To reach
    the hill Bingura’s path must be taken.</p>

  <h3>CHIPADZI’S KRAAL</h3>

  <p>This kraal is three miles south from Zimbabwe, and
    it may be visited on the same round as Suku Glen, Lumbo Rocks, and
    Morgenster. The walk is an interesting one, but there is nothing of
    note in the kraal itself, save the view of the Mapudzi Valley which
    it overlooks. The Morgenster path must be taken for 1,000 yds. south
    of the temple, where a well-defined native path branches off to the
    south-east. Later the path descends into a long, narrow valley till
    it approaches the kraal. The scenery in this valley is very fine. A
    small perennial stream, which at one point disappears under the ground
    for a quarter of a mile, flows down the valley, and on either side
    of it are palm trees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> and tree-ferns, each with a trunk some 3 to 8
    ft. in height, also large areas covered with the royal fern (<i>Osmunda
    regalis</i>). Mahobohobo trees are plentiful, and orchids are abundant on
    the branches of the larger trees. The kraal comprises about a score
    of huts. There is a very grand view towards the east of the Mapudzi
    Valley down which flows the Mapudzi, a stream which has its rise on
    the east side of the Elliptical Temple. The ravine is at least 200
    ft. immediately below the kraal which overlooks it. The two large and
    prominent kopjes on the south are Moroma, the nearer one, and Rugutsi.
    Morgenster is one mile west on the summit of the high land on that side.</p>

  <h3>MAPAKU, OR “LITTLE ZIMBABWE”</h3>

  <p>A walk to these ruins is one of the
    most interesting in the vicinity of the Zimbabwe. They lie south-east
    of Zimbabwe at a distance of less than eight miles, and the path runs
    through the romantic scenery of the Beroma Hills and the Motelekwe
    Valley. The best way to reach the ruins is through Chenga’s kraal, past
    Mandiara’s, which overlooks the lower country on the south side of the
    Beroma Range, and past the picturesquely situated kraal of Mapaku,
    which is at the foot of a tall cliff a quarter of a mile north-west
    of the ruins. The ruins are not extensive (see description of Mapaku
    Ruins, chapter xxi.), but are well worth inspection. To return to
    Zimbabwe the path may be taken to some large pools in the Motelekwe
    River, and from there through Gobele’s kraal near to, and on to,
    Chipadzi’s kraal, which is about three miles from Zimbabwe. Making the
    round journey as suggested enables the visitor to see native life as it
    is lived beyond the ordinary tracks of the white man. The best time of
    day to take this walk is to start just before sunrise and arrive at the
    ruins before the heat can be felt, and so return to Zimbabwe in good
    time for lunch.</p>

  <h3>SCHLICHTER GORGE</h3>

  <p>This is the ravine a mile to the south<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>-west of
    Zimbabwe, down which flows the Mapudzi stream southwards. The walk
    in certain parts is somewhat rough, while in the rainy season owing
    to swollen tributaries and dense jungles of tall reeds it is almost
    inaccessible. To approach it one takes the path down the valley at the
    south foot of East Ruins, and directly east of Maund Ruins, and follows
    a small stream, the banks of which are shaded by trees and covered
    with royal fern. In the dry season there is very little water flowing,
    but there are always small pools. The path crosses this stream at its
    junction with the Mapudzi, the right bank of which must be taken. Where
    the sides of the valley close in the rocky sides of the hills must
    be climbed and then descended again. Along the course of the stream,
    which is densely wooded at the gorge, and flows between large boulders
    causing numerous pretty waterfalls even in the dry season, are some
    delightfully shaded pools, round which orchids and palms, and also
    ferns of rarer species, are to be found in great quantities. Where the
    gorge opens out at its southern end on to a wide valley a steep path,
    which leads up to Chipadzi’s kraal, must be taken. From the kraal a
    fine view of the gorge is obtained.</p>

  <h3>CHICAGOMBONI HILL (NINI DISTRICT)</h3>

  <p>This is where the rediscoverer
    of the Great Zimbabwe ruins, Adam Renders, a German-American, lived
    from 1868 to 1871. Renders was known to the natives as “Sa-adama,”
    and to this day the Makalanga speak well of him, and are particularly
    anxious that all Europeans should know that everything which “Sa-adama”
    bought from them he always paid for. Mogoma, an old man of exceptional
    intelligence, is the native chief in this locality, and knew Renders
    intimately, as the latter lived in his village and made it the centre
    for his elephant-hunting expeditions, on which Mogoma often accompanied
    him. One of Renders’ hunting “boys” still lives in the neighbouring
    village of M’Tibi. Elephants in those days were very plenti<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>ful,
    especially in the Beka and Mali districts. Renders, the natives say,
    was a tall, strong man. He first arrived in Mr. Stokes’ wagon. Mr.
    Stokes was a well-known preoccupation pioneer whose native name was
    “Setokwe.” Mogoma’s kraal has been moved from the hill to the valley on
    the south-west side. The chief states he never knew of the waterfall
    near Renders’ hut as described by Mr. Philips, and certainly owing to
    the formation of the rock it is difficult to see where there could have
    been one. In other respects the description of the spot where Renders
    lived in the Nini country (R. G. S. Journals, Dec., 1900, and Feb.,
    1901) is accurate, save that Chicagomboni is eleven miles south-west of
    Zimbabwe. Mogoma has distinct recollections of the visits of Dr. Mauch
    and Mr. Philips to Renders about 1871, and states that Cherimbila, the
    paramount chief, also visited Renders at this spot. Both Renders and
    Dr. Mauch took Mr. Philips to see Zimbabwe, but they did not stay long
    there.</p>

  <p>After living in Mogoma’s village a little over two years, Renders moved
    to Chirimbila’s kraal, a few miles north of Mogoma’s, and lived there
    for three years, when he died. He was buried close to the kraal.</p>

  <p>The Chicagomboni Hill is at the south-western extremity of the Livouri
    Range, and on the west side has a precipitous drop of about 700 ft.
    Half-way up the face of the cliffs is a narrow ledge running across
    them, and at the northern end of the ledge, and on a raised rock
    platform, was Renders’ abode, the remains of which can still be seen.
    Mogoma’s old kraal was on this ledge. At the point where was Renders’
    hut, the cliff, at a height of 60 ft. above the ledge, protrudes
    outwards some 50 ft., thus forming a lofty and gigantic roof over the
    place were Renders lived. This is known as <i>I-Baku</i>—the cave. There are
    some narrow fissures in the face of the cliff which open out on to the
    ledge, but not one of these is worthy of the name of cave. In these
    Renders stored his trading goods and ivory.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

  <p>From this point is gained one of the finest and most extensive views
    in Rhodesia. It extends over M’Chibi district, the valley of the Tokwe,
    the Belingwe Hills, the Selukwe Hills, and the high ground further to
    the west and north-west. Three hundred feet directly below is Mogoma’s
    new kraal and the adjoining village of Passi. Anyone staying a few days
    at Zimbabwe should not miss visiting this spot. The path from Zimbabwe
    leads past Motumi’s and Masua’s kraals, ascending all the way. Any of
    the “boys” at Mogabe’s kraal would act as guide, but on arrival at
    the hill it would be well to send for Mogoma, or one of his headmen,
    as this would dispense with the necessity of descending some hundreds
    of feet to the valley, in addition to which the approach to the ledge
    being hidden among large rocks, it is difficult to reach it without a
    local guide.</p>

  <h3>A JAUNT ALONG THE ZIMBABWE AND MOTELEKWE ANCIENT ROAD</h3>

  <p>One often wondered along what part of the country on the south or east of
    Great Zimbabwe lay the ancient road from the coast to this old-world
    metropolitan centre. Several suggestions more or less possible have
    been made since the preoccupation days as to the ancient road. That
    the ruins at Mapaku (the caves), seven miles distant towards the
    south-east, formed one of the posting stations on such a road may be
    considered as highly probable. Visitors have generally favoured the
    conjecture that the road from Zimbabwe to Mapaku must have passed to
    the north of the Beroma Range, which, seen from Zimbabwe, from which it
    is two miles distant, forms a continuous granite rampart some 600 ft.
    high, four miles long, and about one and a half miles broad, stretching
    from north to south. This range appears to present a solid obstacle
    to any approach from Zimbabwe. A detour round its north end and along
    its eastern base as far as Mapaku would make the distance at least ten
    miles. Moreover, on this line the kopjes and valleys have recently
    been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span> thoroughly searched for any traces of ancient occupation, and
    none have been found. This therefore shows that such suggested route,
    had it actually been the ancient road, would have been altogether
    undefended for ten miles in an awkward country where the valleys,
    gorges, kloofs, and boulders would have provided splendid vantage
    points for attacks on the gold- and ivory-laden convoys proceeding from
    Zimbabwe to the coast.</p>

  <p>Schlichter Gorge, running south at the east end of Zimbabwe Valley, has
    also been suggested as the ancient approach to Zimbabwe. Certainly,
    viewed from the Acropolis, this would appear to be the only natural
    road, but the position of the gorge, as can be seen when visited,
    negatives the suggestion. The gorge at its southern end is practically
    impassable. It is filled up at several points with solid sections of
    cliff which have fallen into it from the steep sides on either hand,
    and though the Mapudzi stream finds its way under these obstructions,
    the traveller must climb the almost perpendicular sides some seventy to
    a hundred feet to descend again beyond the obstructions, and further on
    repeat the climbing to pass a further barrier. In this gorge and on the
    summit of its cliffs there are no traces of walls to defend the defile,
    while an enemy could easily destroy the convoy, for the pass forms a
    veritable military trap. The distance from Zimbabwe to Mapaku in this
    direction would be at least nine miles.</p>

  <p>Thus these two conjectured routes may for many reasons be dismissed
    as impracticable. But there remain two other possible routes to be
    considered, and both of these pass over the Beroma Range. The first,
    the one traversed by Mr. Bent and by all visitors to Mapaku, keeps to
    the Motelekwe track past East Kopje (Mazanda) till opposite Chenga’s
    kraal, through which the path leads, and up the long trough-like valley
    on the Beroma Range, which depression is formed by the two parallel
    lines of the summits of the range. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span> the east line of summit are
    two depressions, and visitors are taken by the northern of these past
    Mandarali kraal, which is on the edge of the cliff facing east, then
    down the side of the range and along its base southwards to Molinije’s
    kraal at Mapaku. This line of route makes the distance a little over
    seven miles. The local natives say that this path from Zimbabwe to
    Mapaku is a very long one. On it a careful search has failed to
    discover any traces of ruins.</p>

  <p>A well-defined line of route protected at several strategic points
    by ruins of buildings indicates, beyond doubt, the actual road of
    the ancients. This makes the distance barely six miles, which is the
    shortest to Mapaku, and along it runs a much-frequented native track,
    used by the numerous long string of “boys” coming up, between the
    harvest and the sowing, from the districts of the Lower Motelekwe and
    the eastern stretches of the Lundi and Limpopo rivers, to seek work in
    the gold district west of Victoria. The ruins protecting this route
    form a chain of forts, which occur at intervals of about one mile and
    a quarter. On the Zimbabwe-Mapaku section of this route there are the
    remains of five substantial and well-constructed ancient buildings.
    It is along this section and a further section of the chain of ruins
    extending from Zimbabwe to Majerri that the trip here described was
    taken.</p>

  <p>At 3.30 a.m. the six boys to carry blankets, food, cooking utensils,
    survey and photographic apparatus, botanical case, insect bottles,
    rifle, and a few tools, were waiting ready to start for the Majerri
    Ruins in the Motelekwe district, some twenty miles south-east of Great
    Zimbabwe. The moon was almost at the full, but would set an hour before
    sunrise. This is the best time of day to start on a walking expedition,
    as one may then hope to break the back of the distance before the sun’s
    heat could be felt. Five boys took up their loads, each about 35 lbs.,
    and our guide marched on ahead with the rifle. Our little party passed
    down the Motelekwe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span> track till the East Ruins were reached. It was
    perfectly light and a greenish-grey mistiness invested the Valley of
    Ruins, the Acropolis, and the Elliptical Temple. Walking silently we
    passed through the ruins of the dead city to the point where the old
    road to the coast leaves Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p>At East Ruins the track to the upper reaches of the Motelekwe, and to
    Arowi, rounds off at the foot of East Kopje towards the north-east.
    Our path took us slightly south of east. But the Beroma Range looked
    like a Titanic wall of granite cliff barring our passage in that
    direction. “Sheba’s Breasts” (<i>Sueba</i>, black; <i>marsgi</i>, a corruption of
    the word meaning bald-headed), a pair of bare and round-topped hills
    on the southern end of the summit of the range, stand clearly against
    the greenish sky, and above them the morning star is just appearing.
    <i>Sueba</i> is marked on all maps of Rhodesia as “Mount Sheba”; but the
    names “Sheba’s Breasts” and “Mount Sheba” are very modern indeed,
    dating back only to 1891. This pair of hills can very well be seen
    from the Tokwe, where the old Pioneer Road from the Lundi crosses that
    river. Evidently some member of the column familiar with Mr. Rider
    Haggard’s works, knowing that Great Zimbabwe lay just behind those
    hills, bestowed these names upon them, and so they have been known ever
    since.</p>

  <p>Our path led down a slight valley from East Ruins to the Mapudzi
    stream, and here the Beroma was found not to be such an obstacle to
    our progress as was at first imagined, for on its west side is a broad
    defile leading up to the ledge of land a third way between the base
    and summit of the range, and at the top of the defile, and a hundred
    yards to the left, is a well-built ruin which guards the approach up
    the defile. Chenga’s Ruin, as it is called, occupies a position well
    chosen for defensive purpose, and presents several good architectural
    and constructive features. Here the coastward-bound convoy would first
    realise they had quite left Zimbabwe behind them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span> and would start
    to count the fifteen to twenty days of their tedious and, no doubt,
    highly dangerous journey to the sea, which should bear them in their
    gold-laden argosies homewards, either to the port of Eudaemon (the
    present Aden), or to the <i>Moscha</i> (“harbour”) of Ophir, metropolis of
    the ancient Sabæans, or else, if later, to Ezion-Geber, the Jewish and
    Phœnician port on the Red Sea during the reign of King Solomon.</p>

  <p>Chenga’s Ruin is outside the Zimbabwe ruins’ area, and is the first
    posting station on the road to Sofala. In 1540 the Moslem Arab traders
    in gold and ivory informed the Portuguese that the journey from Sofala
    to Zimbabwe required from fifteen to twenty days (twelve to fifteen
    miles a day), so that the later Arabs must have travelled on foot
    taking native carriers. They too may have used as caravansaries the
    line of ancient forts that stretches from Zimbabwe towards Sofala along
    rivers whose valleys form the natural outlet to the coast for the
    populations of Southern Rhodesia, for they could thus find admirable
    protection at easy intervals for the night, or halt within the walls
    built, possibly, by their remote ancestors. So the ancients leaving
    Chenga’s Ruin might know they had at least fifteen days of tramping
    ahead of them, for no evidence of their employing oxen, horses or
    camels, or any wheeled vehicles, has come to light. The journey may
    have even been longer, owing to the delays of the slave gangs and
    carriers with their burdens of gold and ivory, and to the caution
    needed in passing through a land clearly shown by the protecting
    forts to have been hostile territory. The weary stretch of the Sabi
    Valley lay before them—Sabi, a name which students of Chicaranga and
    of other native languages state has no known derivation, and of which
    the natives emphatically affirm “It is but a name. It means nothing to
    us.” It has therefore been repeatedly conjectured that the name Sabi,
    Sabæ, or Saba has a connection with the river with which they must
    have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span> been very well acquainted. From scriptural accounts we find that
    such duplication of names of places was a practice of the old Semitic
    peoples, as in Havilah, the local and pastoral country, and Havilah,
    the foreign and mineralised country, in a superlative sense the gold
    land, “and the gold of that land is good” (Genesis ii. 12). Instances,
    in fact, occur almost everywhere from the remotest time down to the
    founding of New South Wales, Nova Scotia, New York, and a hundred other
    well-known places.</p>

  <p>Chenga’s Ruin was absolutely unknown to white men, as also were the
    Beroma Ruins, until quite recently. The local natives repeatedly
    denied the existence of any ruins on the Beroma Hills, and this denial
    on their part, so authorities on Makalanga customs say, is perfectly
    natural and to be expected, for all the ruins of this chain, like so
    many others throughout the country, have been used by the Makalanga
    up to the present day as burial-places, and being well aware of the
    clearing of the Zimbabwe ruins, they feared lest these other ruins,
    too, should be explored. But since they have learnt that in the work
    at Zimbabwe the graves have been respected, they appear to be less
    nervous, and as it is known for many miles round that substantial
    rewards will be paid for information as to other and fresh ruins, they
    sometimes volunteer their information and offer themselves as guides.
    Thus some nine additional ruins have now been discovered and inspected.
    But the three ruins on the Beroma Hills which at strategic points guard
    our path were found by the author on making a systematic search of all
    the hills in the district of Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p>From the ledge on the west face of the Beroma Range on which Chenga’s
    Ruin is situated the ground rises gently towards a broad depression
    in the western crest of the range into a long valley, which runs from
    north to south and from end to end of the top of the hills. The path
    after passing through the farmstead of David (a native teacher) passes
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>up the valley southwards for half a mile and then turns east at a
    sharp angle towards the most southerly of the two depressions on the
    eastern crest. Within a few hundred yards, on the right-hand side of
    the path where it turns east, and on a low, rocky knoll, is a second
    ruin—Beroma Ruin—which is well-built, and has a rather fine, rounded
    entrance. The southern half of this ruin is now reduced to a few
    piles of granite blocks. On the south-west side of this ruin is one
    of “Sheba’s Breasts,” Marsgi. On the south side of the path is Sueba,
    the other “Breast.” Half-way between Beroma Ruin and Sueba, and on
    the south side of the path, is a cluster of tall, pillar-like rocks,
    which look in the serene moonlight, and at a little distance, like a
    cathedral built of white stone. The natives call these rocks Rusinga.
    On the left-hand side of the path, on the ridge of the depression on
    the eastern line of summits, is a tall column of huge boulders, which,
    when seen from the south side, exactly resemble one of the soapstone
    birds on beams found by Mr. Bent at Zimbabwe.</p>

  </div>

  <p>On Sueba is another ruin which overlooks the depression, through which
    the path runs south-east down the east side of the Beroma Range towards
    the Mapaku Ruins, which form the fourth posting station from Zimbabwe.
    Climbing Sueba, one can at once see that this line of route, owing to
    the topographical structure of the range, is not only the most direct
    from Zimbabwe, but the most natural for anyone crossing the Beroma
    Range.</p>

  <p>Just as the path starts on the descent to the Mapaku Ruins the
    scenery to the north-east and south, as viewed by moonlight, is truly
    magnificent. Towards the north-east the sky-line is formed by the
    jagged crest of the romantic Livouri and Inyuni Hills, while the
    Moshagashi Valley is wrapped in a mantle of greenish mist, above which
    towers the lofty Arowi Peak in solitary grandeur. Here the ancients on
    their way to the coast would have their last view of Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

  <p>We arrive at Mapaku kraal (<i>Baku</i>, “cave”; <i>Mapaku</i>, “caves”) just
    as the light is sufficient to make the main features of the scenery
    perfectly distinct. Here the sub-chief Molinye and his people are
    already stirring and squatting round fires in the open. The kraal is
    situated at the east base of a cluster of high cliffs, and these cliffs
    are full of caves and deep fissures used as passages. The kraal which
    formerly occupied these rocky vantage grounds is now removed to level
    ground, and built without a fence of any kind. Molinye is a younger
    brother of the Mogabe Handisibishe by the same mother, and takes the
    name of their father, the Mogabe-Molinye. He is an intelligent man and
    very active. He considers himself the custodian of the neighbouring
    ruins of Mapaku, and just as his brother at Zimbabwe says to all
    visitors, “Here is Zimbabwe. One shilling!” so Molinye’s first remark
    to visitors is, “Here are the caves. Two shillings!” or “Here are the
    ruins. Two shillings!” Molinye is very proud of the caves, for here his
    people successfully defied the Matabele and Amaswazi raids. In these
    caves the women, children, cattle and grain were safely hidden, and
    the approaches to them could well be defended by two or three men as
    against a hundred of the enemy.</p>

  <p>Molinye’s tall figure leads the way to the Mapaku Ruins, which since
    1891 have been known as “Little Zimbabwe.” Here our breakfast is laid
    out in the central enclosure, and Molinye sits enviously watching
    the boys eating “bully beef.” Evidently he will not be happy till he
    receives a tin, and he is given one. Still he is not content, and urges
    the payment of a further two shillings for taking us to the ruins. He
    only knows two words of English, and these are “Two shillings,” but
    having already paid him one florin, which is more than his due, he
    fails to draw a second, and is at last content with a box of matches.
    Natives always ask for about ten or twenty times more than they expect
    to receive.</p>

  <p>The sun is just showing above a long black hill—In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>gumaruru—and as
    we have ten to twelve miles to cover before we reach Majerri’s, our
    journey is taken up afresh. There is another ruin at Mandindindi’s,
    lying on our route, but our time will not permit us to visit it on this
    trip.</p>

  <p>From Mapaku the path leads south to the right bank of the Motelekwe,
    about a mile and a half away and near Gobele’s kraal, which is from
    this point of view backgrounded at some distance by the steep and
    rocky Goruma Hill. Here the river is wide, and has, even in the dry
    season, large pools many acres in area. The granite rocks in the bed
    of the river are pierced with round holes a few feet deep, all of
    which have been made by the action of the water. The path then passes
    through Gobele’s kraal and down a small defile towards a drift across
    the river. This drift is only used by the people of the neighbouring
    kraals, and the paths on each side of it are very narrow, while
    the crossing is rather tortuous and slippery. From above the drift
    we continue on the path south-west to the south end of the Goruma
    shoulders at a quarter of a mile distant. We were now at least a mile
    and a half from the river, which has turned south-east through some
    dark-looking, tall kopjes, and from the higher ground we could see that
    the rivers which flow to the Motelekwe form swamps just before reaching
    it, and by keeping on the high ground these are avoided and the rivers
    are more easily crossed. In fact, by taking this path we cut off an
    eastward bend in the Motelekwe, striking it again at a wide, easy, and
    natural drift some eight miles farther on.</p>

  <p>About a mile from Gobele’s we come to the Meziro, a perennial stream,
    300 yds. from which on the east side of the path is the Rumeni Ruin,
    built on the slope of a hill. This ruin occupies an area of 111 ft.
    from east to west and 63 ft. from north to south. The highest wall is
    now only about 6 ft. high. The style of building is peculiar—a large,
    well-built, rounded buttress being at the north entrance, and the walls
    show both superior and inferior workmanship, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span> the western side is
    formed of arcs of circles end on end. The Meziro flows south and east
    of the ruin in the valley below.</p>

  <p>Two hundred yards back along the path and about one hundred yards from
    it on the west side is an old Makalanga wall with portions of the
    wall of an oval enclosure. The structure is of no great age, and is
    definitely claimed by the natives as the work of some few generations
    past. Its total length is 54 ft., and the area of the enclosure is 16
    ft. at its longest parts. Some old Makalanga clay flooring has been
    used as building material at different points in the wall.</p>

  <p>The journey south, and later south-east, is continued, and the Meziro
    and Mazili rivers crossed, while the following kraals are passed in
    order—Chinaka’s to the left, Skarduza’s on the right, and Manamuli also
    on the right. In front is a very high kopje with almost perpendicular
    sides. This is Rushumbi, a noted landmark for many miles round. The
    path leads past the south of this hill and up another hill, where is
    Marota kraal. This hill, which has a very considerable elevation, is
    exceedingly steep on the south side, and there is an extensive view
    from the summit down the Motelekwe and Tokwe valleys. Marota was the
    largest kraal seen on this journey. Half an hour’s walk from Marota
    brought us to a natural drift on the Motelekwe, which here bends
    south-south-east. The river-bed at this point is about 200 yds. wide,
    and in the dry season is very easy to cross, from sandbank island to
    sandbank island and scrambling over large granite rocks with smooth
    glassy surfaces. There is no doubt that this is the best drift within
    a good many miles either up or down the river, and it lies, as seen in
    the distance from Mount Sueba, the eastern “Sheba’s Breast,” exactly in
    the natural and unbroken line of country up which is the easiest and
    most natural approach to Zimbabwe from the south-east, thus avoiding
    bewildering mazes of kopjes and rough country which lie on either side.
    The topography of the country clearly points out the ancient route, and
    it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span> along this that our present journey is made. At this drift we
    saw a boy of about nine years of age with a skin no darker than that
    of an ordinary Spaniard and with almost perfect features. Both parents
    were ascertained to be Makalanga.</p>

  <p>From the east bank of the drift the path ascends for a distance of
    nearly two miles between the drift and the Majerri Ruins, which at
    this distance lie half a mile to the south of the path on a line of
    kopjes to the south-west of another Mapaku (“the caves”). This Mapaku
    must not be confused with the Mapaku we had visited during the small
    hours of the day, for wherever there are caves there is a local Mapaku;
    hence there are several places of this name within a score of miles
    from Zimbabwe. The name of the headman at this Mapaku is Munda, and
    on sending to his village, one of his men will act as guide to the
    ruins, which are rather difficult to find by anyone unacquainted with
    the district. On our way from the drift we passed several very long
    game-drive fences and large game pits, and saw two herds of wild pigs
    and several large buck.</p>

  <p>By three o’clock in the afternoon we had reached the ruins, and a camp
    for the night was made in one of the enclosures. Soon afterwards the
    boys were busy with hatchets cutting away brush from the sides of the
    walls, so that a survey could be made and photographs taken. The ruins
    are much larger and better built than we had been led to believe. There
    are sixteen enclosures, also a passage 290 ft. long running from end
    to end of the ruins. Chevron pattern is on the west face of a very
    substantial wall of what appears to have been an important enclosure.
    We worked at the measurements till it was dark, when we partook of
    our evening meal. The full moon rose a little later and flooded the
    ancient building with light, so that further examinations could be
    made. The enclosure in which our camp for the night was formed was made
    most picturesque with the lights of moon and fire, the walls gleaming
    white with the heavy mantle of lichen which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> covered them. This white
    appearance of the walls is a prominent feature in all the ruins of the
    Motelekwe chain, most probably accounted for by the mists that usually
    hang over the line of the river.</p>

  <p>The talking and singing of the boys, the music of their Makalanga
    pianos, seemed in perfect harmony with the solemn stillness of the
    ruins and of the night. We turned in early, and at five in the morning
    we were again busy completing measurements and noting up descriptions
    of architectural features and styles of construction. At ten o’clock
    the principal parts of the ruins were photographed, and at eleven we
    set out on our return to Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p>The objective of our next expedition down the Motelekwe Valley will be
    another set of ruins still further south-east. There are other ruins
    beyond these again, and we hope to be able by such expeditions to
    obtain full descriptions, with photographs and plans, of all the ruins
    of the Motelekwe chain.</p>

  <p>Munda, the headman at Mapaku (Majerri), states that only three white
    men have ever seen these ruins, two came together and one alone, but
    that these visits were made some years ago. One of the Messrs. Posselts
    was of this number.</p>

  <p>On this journey we found the women were all decorated with the furrow
    pattern on their bare stomachs. The “female breast and furrow pattern”
    was on all washing-tubs, drums, granaries, and furnaces, and also on
    some doors, and further worked out in clay on the sides of the huts.
    Check pattern adorned some of the huts, but mainly the inside walls.
    Some very well-built semi-circular walls for screening open fires were
    found at some of the villages.</p>

  <h3>SOME OF THE DENIZENS OF THE ZIMBABWE DISTRICT</h3>

  <p>These are most
    numerous in the Elliptical Temple when the size of its area is
    considered, for this building abounds in bird, animal, reptile, insect,
    and plant life. Protected by high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span> walls all round, it provides an
    area free from the disturbing effects of grass fires, sheltered from
    cold winds, and full of rank tropical vegetation and jungle. Here the
    gorgeous lapis-lazuli and turquoise blue of the jays and the brilliant
    scarlet and rich metallic green of the honey-sucker flash brightly in
    keen contrast to the white lichened walls. Yellow and grey hornbills,
    barn owls and owlets, wagtails, weaver birds, pigeons and doves, and
    little birds with yellow, white, red or blue or mottled breasts and
    wings, are constantly to be seen in the temple courts. One large barn
    owl has its usual perch on a branch near the summit of the Conical
    Tower, while “Go-away” birds are incessantly urging us to “Go away!”</p>

  <p>Numerous squirrels climb the walls and spring along their summits.
    Chameleons, one minute pale green, the next a mottled yellow, grey,
    and black, climb with aristocratic movements up the orchid-clad
    trunks of trees, pausing at intervals to fold their front paws in a
    comic attitude of prayerfulness. Large and small lizards of brilliant
    colourings, mainly magenta, Prussian and electric blues, and a
    startling orange, bask upon the ancient stones. Puff-adders, grass
    snakes, and mambas haunt the place, the latter climbing the highest
    trees and ascending steep, smooth sides without any apparent necessity
    for picking their way up rough surfaces. Pythons have been seen, and
    a python’s nest with about two dozen white leathery eggs, from which
    the young had been recently hatched, was found in the centre of the
    temple. On commencing work here in May, 1902, scores of cast-off
    snake skins of all sizes up to 5 ft. in length were found all about
    the temple. Scorpions which hide under the stones suggest to one the
    necessity of being careful in sitting down. Centipedes and large
    millipedes, snails with white spiral shells from 6 in. to 9 in. long,
    frogs, which on wet days persistently urge us to “Work! work!” abound,
    while after sundown crowds of large night-moths and bats flutter in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
    the air. Brilliant butterflies, dragon flies, and fire flies, gigantic
    spiders, spiders which make their trap-doors of clay, hornets, bees,
    beetles, mosquitoes, and other stinging insects, and those which assume
    imitative forms. Tortoise-shells and porcupine quills were found, but
    no tortoise or porcupine. The number of skeletons of wild animals
    found in the grass was sufficient to suggest thoughts of Noah and his
    zoological cargo.</p>

  <p>The birds of the Zimbabwe district include quantities of blue jays,
    hornbills, honey-birds, honey-suckers, bee-eaters, several sorts of
    rollers, crested kingfishers, South African thrushes and babbling
    thrushes, shrikes, swifts, swallows, and martins, weaver birds, owls,
    corncrakes, night jars, woodpeckers, larks, wagtails, doves, pigeons,
    white storks, herons, secretary birds, bush crows, vultures, hawks,
    guinea-fowl, sand grouse, quails, and partridges, while paaw (bush
    bustard) is sometimes met with.</p>

  <p>Two ostriches with black and white feathers once approached within
    100 yds. of Havilah Camp. A covey of African grey parrots fled over
    the huts going south in the springtime. One bird of the plumage and
    shape of an ordinary skylark soars high in the air, remaining in one
    position, but instead of singing it flaps its wings loudly for some
    minutes together. It is best heard just before sunrise.</p>

  <p>During the dry season game animals are not plentiful in this locality,
    but when the grass has started to grow after a veld fire they arrive in
    fairly good numbers. Reed buck, sable antelope, and springbok have been
    within sight of the camp.</p>

  <p>Lions for some years past have not been seen at Zimbabwe, though they
    are in continuous residence on the Livouri Range, some eight miles to
    the west, and also at one or two other places about the same distance
    from Zimbabwe. But with the advent of buck they are known to come
    within two or three miles of our camp. Their spoor has frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span> been
    seen on the road between Zimbabwe and Victoria, and they have recently
    killed donkeys within five miles of Zimbabwe. On one occasion only
    have we heard lions roaring, and they must have been almost two miles
    away. Jackals are a nuisance, and come to the camp for poultry. Large
    leopards have been shot in the neighbourhood during the author’s stay
    at Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p>Natives state that within their time herds of tusker elephants have
    been wont to frequent the Zimbabwe Valley, and they point out certain
    trees which have been damaged by them. The elephants have now gone
    south-east. The traces of two ivory trading stations of the late
    sixties are still to be seen at Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p>Eagles soar above Zimbabwe Hill and the topmost line of cliffs. Two
    eaglets fallen from the nest were found in the Acropolis ruins, one
    each spring. One died of its injuries, and the other lived for two
    months at our camp. The boys were fond of feeding “the big chicken,”
    and it eventually died in consequence of its gluttony. Hawks abound on
    the hill, and there are also kites and owls. Large black crows with a
    white patch on the back of the neck, and with vulture-shaped beak, also
    crows with white breast and wing tips, but with a raven-shaped beak,
    are constantly flying round the hill. Here are also wild tebie cats and
    tiger cats, ant-bears, conies, squirrels, and at least five species of
    large baboons. The constant parading of the latter to and fro on the
    summit has formed a well-beaten track. These creatures bark and cry—the
    crying is exactly like that of a human being. Toward noon they usually
    descend to the valley and romp about on the open granite spaces. So
    destructive are these particular baboons that the local Makalanga have
    been obliged to abandon their gardens on the south side of the hill.
    Their spoor has been frequently found within our camp. The reptiles
    here are large pythons, mambas, iguanas, and lizards of all colours.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

  <p>The plant life found in the temple was very rich and diversified, and
    each specimen was of larger growth and bloom than those of the same
    species growing outside the walls. Here are many sorts of elegant
    ferns, but mostly small, including maiden-hair fern, also the ordinary
    bracken. Stag’s-horn moss and plants of carnose foliage grow in
    the joints of the walls. Beds of scarlet cannæ, Cape gooseberries,
    raspberries, crimson and mauve gladioli, convolvuli, large and small,
    white, purple, yellow, and mauve, verbenas, heliotrope, azaleas, also
    a flower exactly like the daffodil, and arums or St. John’s lilies,
    flags, mauve-flowered peas, a blue flower like borage, and blue and
    yellow ground orchids, covered the surface of the interior. Nettles
    and nettle trees, stinging plants, and thorns of all sorts formed
    prominent features in the vegetation of the temple. The trees within
    the walls were numerous, and included varieties of hard and soft
    woods. Some were of gigantic girth and height, rising to 60 ft. Wild
    fig-trees and evergreen hardwoods predominate. The “Zimbabwe creeper,”
    a climbing plant peculiarly local, is a great feature in all the ruins
    at Zimbabwe, and so far has not been found elsewhere in Rhodesia.
    This creeper resembles jessamine in leaf and stalk, only it has light
    pink, bell-shaped pendent flowers growing in clusters at the end of
    each spray, these being about the shape and size of a foxglove flower.
    Orchids with yellow flowers grow on the trees, from which are also
    suspended lichen festoons some 3 ft. long. The monkey-rope trees once
    interlaced the tops of the trees with their runners and created a
    semi-darkness in the temple even at brightest noontide.</p>

  <p>On the hill tobacco, once cultivated here by the natives, now grows
    wild. Large beds of scarlet cannæ, Cape gooseberries, hemlocks, and
    blackjacks are seen in most parts of the hill, while every flower of
    the veld is represented. Monkey-ropes, wild vines, wild orange, fig,
    nut, greengage, currant, and raspberry flourish here. The kafir-baum,
    which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span> flowers profusely when leafless early in the spring, and abounds
    at Zimbabwe, provides a striking contrast of brilliant scarlet to the
    grey granite cliffs in front of which it flourishes. The flat-topped
    umbrella trees (<i>mimosa</i>) impart an odd effect to the hill. The
    Zimbabwe creeper grows very extensively on the north and west sides
    of the hill. Cacti, euphorbia, and liliums, also bulbous plants, are
    multifarious, while tall aloes give an old-world appearance to the hill.</p>

  <p>Palms with fronds 10 ft. long, tree-ferns 8 ft. high, and large
    areas of <i>Osmunda regalis</i> (royal fern) are to be seen in most of
    the glens and gorges of this locality. The blue lotus lily (<i>Nymphæa
    stellata</i>) grows in most pools of water, while the yellow everlasting
    flower (<i>Helipterum incanum</i>) is plentiful, and the bright red
    sealing-wax-coloured flower (<i>Erythrina kaffra</i>) shots the veld grass
    as daisies do an English meadow. The sugar bush (<i>Protea mellifera</i>)
    though present is not found in quantity. Bamboos grow in the
    neighbourhood, also sugar-cane, and wild cotton. The mahobohobo is not
    indigenous to the country, but is the most usual tree found here. Its
    area covers many square miles of this district. Like the wild fig, the
    mahobohobo fruit ripens in the spring only.</p>

  <h3>1. NATIVES AND RUINS</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap">IT may easily be imagined that researches as to the origin of the ruins
    cannot be furthered by inquiries instituted among the present native
    peoples as to any history or tradition concerning these structures.
    The chief value, however, of such inquiries is that they enable us to
    realise in what conditions both the ruins and the district have existed
    during the last few centuries. But such inquiries only take us back
    to a period of two hundred years short of that time when Portuguese
    writers referred to these buildings.</p>

  <p>The migratory character of the South African natives is well known.
    Not only whole nations move, but the tribes among themselves move
    also, thus making it exceedingly difficult to trace their migrations
    except for a few generations back. The Portuguese historians of the
    sixteenth and seventeenth centuries referred to the Makalanga nation as
    occupying this country with their centre at “the Great Zimbabwe,” where
    resided the Monomotapa, or supreme chief, and where was “the mightie
    wall of five and twenty spans thick.” Three hundred years after this
    was written we find a dense population of Makalanga (“the People of
    the Sun”) still occupying Southern Mashonaland and forming the great
    bulk of its inhabitants.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In this respect, though <span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>their various
    tribes have frequently changed localities, the Makalanga as a general
    rule have not followed the migratory custom of South African peoples.
    Makalanga are to be found in both Matabeleland and Mashonaland, but
    mainly in the latter province, where the Chicaranga language, which Dos
    Santos in 1602 described as “the best and most polished of all Kafir
    languages which I have seen in this Ethiopia,” is still the language of
    the nation. Makalanga are also to be found in Barotseland, whither the
    Barotse<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and their dependents the Makalanga migrated, in 1836–8, just
    previously to, and at the time of, the Matabele invasion of what is now
    known as Matabeleland.</p>

    <div class="caption">THE CAMP WATCHMAN (KUMURI)</div>
  </div>

  <p>But for nearly four hundred years the historical relations and the
    very existence of the Makalanga and their history were forgotten. From
    being a powerful and semi-civilised people (see <cite>The Ancient Ruins of
    Rhodesia</cite>, chapter x.) they have become a people of no account—mere
    “Makalaka,” as the people of the present Bechuanaland scornfully
    called them in reference to their present slavish position. To their
    successive conquerors they have always been but “dogs of slaves.”</p>

  <p>So far as the purely local natives are concerned, the following notes,
    based upon a series of conferences of the oldest native authorities
    held at Zimbabwe during 1902 and 1903, at which Mr. Alfred Drew,
    Native Commissioner, the Rev. A. A. Louw, Dutch Reformed Mission
    near Zimbabwe, and Dr. Helm, Medical Missionary, and other admitted
    authorities on native language and customs, have taken part, will
    explain the local occupations for almost if not more than one hundred
    and fifty years. The local Makalanga, Barotse, and Amangwa are
    agreed upon the correctness of the statements here recorded, and the
    information so obtained has also been verified by the above-named
    gentlemen in other quarters.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) In this portion of Southern Mashonaland the Makalanga have
    formed, since long before 1570, the greatest portion of the population,
    especially in the Zimbabwe district. This is both history and also
    well-rooted tradition among the natives, going back for very many
    generations.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) The Makalanga have been subject to several successive conquerors,
    of whom the Barotse in Mashonaland and the Matabele in Matabeleland
    were the last. They have only very indistinct traditions as to their
    previous conquerors.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) The Barotse occupied both provinces, establishing central
    strongholds in all districts. They collected tribute from the
    Makalanga, and this was taken every year from all the centres to the
    <i>Mambo</i> or <i>Mamba</i>, the dynastic chief, for the time being, of the
    Barotse. And these Mambos resided at Thabas Imamba. Both Makalanga
    and Barotse were, and still are, most excellent builders with stones.
    [Mr. Drew minutely cross-examined the natives with regard to the
    situation or identity of Thabas Imamba]. This is the fixed belief of
    every Barotse who is questioned on the subject, and the old men say
    it is also within their own knowledge. Before this fresh evidence
    was obtained, the authors of <cite>The Ancient Ruins of Rhodesia</cite> had
    published a similar statement on the strength of evidences secured in
    Matabeleland. Mr. Neal also stated that no ruin in Rhodesia showed more
    evidences of extensive and prolonged occupation than did the ruins on
    Thabas Imamba.</p>

  <p>(<i>d</i>) Jerri’s people (Barotse) never lived at or near Zimbabwe, as
    white men had believed they had, but they left what they called “The
    Great Buildings of Stone” (Khami) west of where Bulawayo now stands
    in 1836–7, and moved to Jerri Mountains, seventy miles south of
    Zimbabwe. They left Khami immediately before the Matabele arrived.
    On passing through Zimbabwe they encamped for one night only on a
    hill one mile west of the ruins. There are many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span> old men who remember
    these circumstances, while the general local belief is that Jerri’s
    people lived at Khami Ruins, which are well known to the natives here.
    [It has always been contended that this tribe of Barotse resided at
    Khami for very many generations, but there are very many evidences in
    support of this established belief, which are now in hand, and are now
    forthcoming.]</p>

  <p>(<i>e</i>) The head kraal of the Zimbabwe Barotse was at the foot of the
    south-east side of the Rusivanga Kopje, and not on the summit, where
    the walls and the remains of very substantial huts are old Makalanga.
    The Barotse also had a large kraal on the north-east side of the
    Bentberg overlooking the Elliptical Temple. [The present Barotse
    headmen claim the pottery in the débris at these places as having
    been made by their people some four or five generations back, if not
    earlier.]</p>

  <p>(<i>f</i>) The Zimbabwe Makalanga did not reside in the ruins, as this in
    later generations was opposed to their traditions, but they used the
    ruins up to ten years ago as cattle kraals and places for carrying on
    their copper and iron-smelting operations, for offering sacrifices,
    and for burial-places. Once they occupied them as residences, but
    possibly the fear of the ruins at night caused them to desert them as
    residences, probably owing to the increased number of graves which they
    contained. The Barotse did not appear to have been inspired by this
    fear, for they have occupied ruins all over the country.</p>

  <p>All the remains of native huts and many of the native articles found
    in the ruins must be at least six generations old, if not much older.
    When the present Mogabe Handisibishe took up his residence on the
    north side of Zimbabwe Hill, in the ruins of the Acropolis, there had
    been no Makalanga occupations for many generations previously. All
    the remains of Makalanga huts found on the Acropolis, and round the
    faces of the hill, and outside the area occupied by Mogabe’s kraal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
    belong to Makalanga, who had ceased to occupy them for very many years
    previously. When Mogabe arrived these remains were considered by his
    people to be exceedingly old.</p>

  <p>(<i>g</i>) The present Zimbabwe Makalanga originally came from Masungye, in
    the direction of the Lower Sabi. Mogabe is the dynastic title of each
    succeeding chief of this tribe. The Mogabe-Molinye moved to Jena and
    finally to the Beroma country, in the neighbourhood of Zimbabwe. The
    succeeding Mogabe, a son of Molinye, moved up from Beroma to Mangwa
    (Morgenster), four miles south of Zimbabwe, from which place he drove
    out the Amangwa people, who occupied the Zimbabwe district and the
    country for a considerable distance round about. The next Mogabe,
    Chipfuno, a son of the previous Mogabe, settled at Wuwuli, five miles
    south of Zimbabwe, and later his younger brother, Handisibishe, the
    present Mogabe, succeeded Chipfuno in the dynastic rule. Handisibishe
    is seventy years of age, but Chipfuno was much older.</p>

  <p>The connection between the present Zimbabwe Makalanga and the Zimbabwe
    ruins only dates back authoritatively for some sixty or seventy years,
    but their opinion as to the age of the native remains at the ruins, as
    found by them when they arrived, added to a similar account based on
    the longer residence of the Barotse and Amangwa, and on their history
    and traditions, enables investigations to be carried back at least
    eight generations.</p>

  <p>(<i>h</i>) The oldest known natives who have resided at Zimbabwe are the
    Amangwa, who were driven out by Mogabe Handisibishe. These were
    originally a tribe of pure Makalanga, but by marriage with their
    erstwhile over-lords, the local Barotse, many of their people have
    acquired some of the distinctive features of the Barotse, while a large
    proportion are still in every respect true Makalanga. These people now
    reside in Nini district, eight miles south-west of Zimbabwe, their
    nearest kraal being Bingura’s, which is two miles distant. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>They can
    speak with regard to the state of the ruins as they were conditioned
    some generations ago. They state they never occupied the Acropolis
    ruins except when Amaswazi raiding parties were in the district,
    and then only as a temporary refuge, and that many large walls have
    completely fallen down. The Amangwa were once a numerous and powerful
    people. Their kraals were built in the valleys, close to the ruins and
    on the nearest kopjes.</p>

  <p>Mogabe Handisibishe took advantage of a famine in the Zimbabwe district
    when he attacked them, and perpetrated great cruelties on their women
    in order to make them divulge where the relics from the ruins were
    hidden, but the Amangwa did not yield on this point. It is curious
    that so many relics of prehistoric value have been found in the Nini
    district where the Amangwa now reside. The wooden bowl, carved with the
    zodiacal signs, the soapstone cylinder, etc., were discovered in Nini,
    and the best native authorities affirm that the Amangwa still have
    relics in their possession.</p>

  <p>(<i>i</i>) The correct name for Zimbabwe is <i>Zim-b[=a]b-[=gw]i</i>, meaning
    “buildings or houses of stones.” The natives never apply the name
    <i>Zim-bab-gwi</i> to the Elliptical Temple, but always speak of it as
    <i>Rusingu</i>, “the wall.” <i>Zim-bab-gwi</i> is only applied to the ruins on
    the hill.</p>

  <p>(<i>j</i>) The natives have no recollection or tradition with regard to the
    Monomotapas, the dynastic chiefs of the mediæval Makalanga who resided
    at Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p>(<i>k</i>) Barotse, Amangwa, and Makalanga have built walls in and near the
    ruins. They state that their ancestors used to construct excellent
    walls. [Mr. Drew, <span class="smcap">n.c.</span>, is of opinion that the Barotse now
    build better walls than do the present Makalanga. The Makalanga were
    always famous as good builders with stone.]</p>

  <p>(<i>l</i>) The natives show little or no interest as to the original
    builders of the ruins. Some will say they were built by white men for
    prisons, others will affirm the ancestors of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> their tribe built them.
    Some tribes make definite claims to have built them, but Mr. Drew
    considers these claims to be only poetic expressions conveying the idea
    that such tribes had lived for so very many generations in the ruins
    that they knew of no occupiers before them, and so imagine that their
    ancestors must have built them. Of course, their claims to have built
    minor walls within the ruins are, in many instances, obviously well
    founded.</p>

  <p>(<i>m</i>) The natives assert, when pressed as to who removed the relics
    from the ruins, that large birds came out of the sky, took them, and
    carried them into the heavens.</p>

  <p>(<i>n</i>) “Fuko-ya-Nebandge”—the Mashonaland relic—possesses an unique
    history and a weird romance, and is also of great intrinsic value
    for such in Rhodesia as revel in researches into the history of past
    occupiers of this country. The image is made of pottery, and is
    hollow, the head (which has not been discovered) forming the stopper.
    It was discovered by Mr. Harry Posselt in a cave near Zimbabwe. It
    stands 11 in. high, and is about 16 in. long, and is marked with
    geometric exactness with zebra stripes all over its body. The pot is
    black, but the stripes are of a dull red colour. The name of it is
    “Fuko-ya-Nebandge” (“the king’s favourite adviser”), and for at least
    some generations of Makalanga it has exercised a potent magic spell
    over the minds of the natives. It has now been secured for the museum
    at Bulawayo.</p>

  <p>The following is Mr. Posselt’s account of its discovery:—</p>

  <p>In 1891 he was encamped at Fern Spruit, south of Victoria, near which
    point are some hills. His Mashona boy informed him that among these
    hills could be heard by anyone going near them the sound of cattle
    bellowing, girls talking and singing, and that up on the hills was
    a pot full of beads, but the local natives were too much afraid of
    venturing up there in search of the pot, as it would mean certain
    death. He did not ascend the hills, but his drivers and leaders went
    up, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span> heard and saw nothing unusual. Until 1899 he had quite
    forgotten the incident, but in August of 1900 he happened to be near
    these particular hills collecting labour for the Chamber of Mines, and
    conversed with a chief living there. He asked the chief the native
    name of the hills, and the chief told him about the pot containing the
    beads. He further told him that long ago a native went out hunting
    on the hills, and found the pot with the beads in. The chief’s story
    was to the effect that the native seeing the pot wanted to take the
    beads out, and putting his hand into the pot, the pot got hold of his
    hands and he could not shake it off, and he was obliged to carry the
    pot poised on his head with his hand still fixed inside it. When he
    arrived at the kraal his people prevented him entering it, as he might
    bring evil upon the tribe. He was consequently compelled to encamp on a
    stream near the kraal until his hand dropped off. He was fed secretly
    by some of his people. After his death, instead of being buried in the
    usual way, they pushed him with long sticks into a cave.</p>

  <p>The pot was left there for some considerable time afterwards, and it
    was eventually discovered in another cave in the same hills, and was
    regarded, and still is to this day, by the natives as a mystery, and
    held in awe by them, and their belief was that if anyone approached the
    cave he would die. If the pot changed its colours to dark red it meant
    certain death.</p>

  <p>After he had secured the pot the natives came from near and far to
    see it. One old native then told him of another pot, made like a mare
    zebra, and that the “female pot” contained beads that glittered, and
    that the pot in his (Mr. Posselt’s) possession was the “male pot.” The
    native was ignorant of what gold was. The two pots, so he stated, used
    to travel by themselves from their cave to Fulachama, a distance of
    eight miles, to obtain water from the stream where they drank, coming
    and going so often as to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span> a path. This Kafir asked where the
    “female pot” was, well knowing Mr. Posselt had not found it.</p>

  <p>After his discovery he went to a chief who lives close by to where the
    pot was found. This chief used to live in Zimbabwe. He said that the
    chief who now lives in Zimbabwe was an enemy of his, and had supplanted
    him, and that he had all the relics. To compel him to disclose the
    place where the relics were hidden he resorted to torture, cutting off
    women’s breasts and putting nose reims through men’s noses. Before
    the ex-Zimbabwe chief was expelled from Zimbabwe he was in the habit
    of offering up sacrifices of black oxen, and on each occasion used to
    collect and display relics taken from the ruins. These consisted of
    “yellow metal with sharp points” brought down from the top ruin, also a
    yellow stick about 3 ft. 6 in. long with a knob on it, also a bowl or
    dish, by information most probably of silver. The stick is now stated
    to be in the possession of the chief.</p>

  <h3>2. LOCAL NATIVES (GENERAL)</h3>

  <p>The Zimbabwe district is very thickly populated by Makalanga. These
    formerly lived in natural strongholds on the summits of rocky kopjes
    difficult of approach, but now in almost every instance they have
    removed their kraals from their almost inaccessible eyries, and have
    built their villages on open country, without erecting any fences
    whatsoever for their protection. Thus, locally, Mogabe has left his
    hill fortress and caves, Baranazimba his strongly defended rocks, Lumbo
    his rock-pillar, and now these three kraals, as in many scores of
    other instances, are built in open country in absolutely indefensible
    positions, with no post, rail, or thornbush to bar approach. At night
    one can pass through almost any village unchallenged save by a Kafir
    dog. Large stores of corn are in their granaries. Their belongings
    are strewn about outside their huts, and everything is open to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>the
    spoiler. But the inhabitants sleep soundly, assured and content,
    because they recognise they are safe under the rule of a civilised
    Government.</p>

    <div class="caption">THE MOGABE, HANDISIBISHE, CHIEF OF THE ZIMBABWE MAKALANGA</div>
  </div>

  <p>Slightly more than a decade since all was most terribly different.
    Tribe fought with tribe and village with village. Repeated Amaswazi
    and Matabele raids “wiped out” without warning and without mercy whole
    populations, capturing slaves, seizing the women, and killing, as was
    their practice, the old people and children. None dared to stir from
    his rocky fastness to cultivate his little patch of ground. Little
    wonder is it that the spirit of these people was broken.</p>

  <p>To-day these Makalanga, who are essentially an agricultural race, have
    covered the erstwhile devastated country with their plantations, and
    converted these parts into the “Granary of Rhodesia,” and the leading
    grain-producing district of this part of Mashonaland. Standing on
    Zimbabwe Hill either at sunrise or sunset, one sees scattered over the
    open country scores of columns of smoke rising from the villages, each
    with its large area where the Makalanga work in absolute security,
    and one is forced to realise that untold benefit has undoubtedly been
    conferred upon the natives by the British occupation.</p>

  <p>The Makalanga of Zimbabwe district are considered to be, in
    intellectual and physical qualifications, above many of their tribes
    elsewhere. In some respects they are marvellously intelligent and quick
    to perceive, shrewd, calculating, and clever, while in others they are
    astonishingly dull, so that it is almost impossible to get them to
    understand the simplest matter. They certainly evince far more feeling
    and sensitiveness, are more amenable to direction, and readier and more
    anxious to work, and are more honest and reliable than the average
    Matabele. Physically, they are as a whole somewhat shorter in height,
    are less robust, and have not the weight and strength of the Matabele,
    but their vigour and agility give them the greater advantage. Yet there
    are very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span> many Makalanga in this district equal to any Matabele in
    height, strength, form, and endurance.</p>

  <p>More than the French nation among Europeans, the Makalanga are
    distinguished for their taste, tact, and courtesy among the Kafir races
    of South-East Africa, only in their case the graceful movement, kingly
    walk, politeness, neatness, rhythm of speech, and poetic expression,
    are not the outcome of study, but are perfectly natural qualities bred
    in the race.</p>

  <p>The contact of these people for many generations with the Portuguese
    is shown in their speech. This is a feature noticeable in all native
    tribes in Mashonaland, which were at any time located in or near
    Portuguese territory. As stated below, Mogabe’s people originally came
    from the direction of the border. The terminations of some of their
    words are as distinctly Portuguese as one may hear at Lisbon or Oporto.
    Their connection with the Portuguese caused them to follow the rule
    common to that and some other Latin nations, viz. the interchange of
    <i>R</i> and <i>L</i>. <i>Selukwe</i> thus becomes <i>Serukwe</i>, <i>Belingwe Beringwe</i>,
    <i>Bulawayo Burawayo</i>, while in almost every word used by their people
    further west containing <i>L</i> the latter is substituted for <i>R</i>. Locally
    they call themselves Mokaranga (<i>mo</i> is a Chicaranga plural prefix),
    “the people of the sun.” The Portuguese writers, De Barros (1552), Dos
    Santos (1570), and Livio Sanuto (1588), give their name as <i>Mocaranga</i>.
    <i>Makalaka</i>, the name of derision bestowed upon them by the tribes in
    Bechuanaland, is known to them, but is never used by them, nor is
    <i>M’Holi</i> (slaves), a title which some of the more degenerate Makalangas
    in Matabeleland have adopted as their personal and tribal name.</p>

  <p>The <i>totem</i> or distinguishing sign of the local tribe of Makalanga is
    <i>moyo</i>, the heart. Each tribe has its own totem, which may be the leg
    of a certain buck or some particular bird. Should a bird or an animal
    be the totem the tribe bearing that sign do not eat of the flesh of
    such bird or animal, nor will they kill them. A man of one totem must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
    not marry a wife of a tribe bearing the same totem, but must seek one
    of a tribe of Makalanga having another totem. Thus, as they affirm,
    “Heart must not marry Heart, nor Lion marry Lion.” This rule enforced
    through past ages has no doubt tended to maintain and improve their
    physical condition, and accounts for their fine figures, splendid
    health and general freedom from illnesses, and the almost utter absence
    of deformity and lunacy. A tribe of the Baduma people also bears the
    totem of the heart. The sub-tribal totem of the local Barotse<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> is
    the lion. The lion, which is also the totem of the local Amangwa, only
    includes rapacious animals, such as wild cats, wild dogs, etc. Certain
    families in the same tribe or kraal have distinguishing signs, or what
    may be termed sub-totems. The totem system also prevailed amongst the
    early Semitic peoples prior to biblical times, and was later a feature
    of Hebrew history; for instance, “The Lion of the tribe of Judah.” The
    totem of the Ephraimites was a bull.</p>

  <p>In addition to the animal or bird that may constitute the totem
    there are other animals and birds which they venerate, and will not
    kill, eat, or touch. The slaying of such creatures is regarded as a
    crime against the whole of the tribe. The spirits of dead ancestors,
    relatives, and chiefs are supposed to reside in such birds and animals.
    The principal bird of local reverence is the <i>Harahurusei</i> (Bird of
    God), which is the <i>chapungo</i>, a large and beautiful bird, quite black
    except its tail, which is red. The peculiarity of this bird is that
    it soars overhead exactly as does a bird of prey. The natives assert
    that the nest, eggs, or feathers of this bird have never been found
    by anyone, nor do they know on what food it lives. A native will not
    proceed on a journey if the chapungo appears in the air or settles on
    the ground in front of him, but will at once return home. Natives hail
    the bird and ask it for favours.</p>

  <p>The local natives will not eat the following: Common grey <span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>hawk, black
    crow, owl, wolf, crocodile, snake, or wild dog. Some will not eat hippo
    or eland flesh. They will not kill the chapungo, owl, wild dog, heron,
    and certain small birds. But while these are the general practices of
    local Makalanga tribes, certain families in different tribes frequently
    have additional and special objects of veneration, and any one native
    may have some particular object for his own personal veneration. The
    tribal custom with regard to not partaking of the flesh of certain
    birds and animals is very strictly adhered to, even though natives
    starve. To touch such, living or dead, is a defilement, and the remains
    can only be moved by using sticks.</p>

  <p>Of insects, they eat locusts, two kinds of cricket (<i>mashu</i> and
    <i>zukumge</i>), a caterpillar (<i>masonya</i>), a worm called <i>mambene</i>, and
    different kinds of ants, including <i>shua</i> and <i>madjuro</i>, but especially
    flying-ants. All these insects they consider dainties, and cook them in
    the soup-pot into which they dip each handful of <i>rapoka</i> porridge. The
    soup is made of fat, ground monkey-nuts, and many other ingredients.</p>

  <p>The natives are known to draw certain star-pictures in the sky; for
    instance, Orion is made out to be “two pigs and a dog.” The three stars
    in the Belt form one of the principal subjects of children’s songs.
    They, of course, know the Morning and Evening Star, while the Pleiades
    in their rising and setting mark the sowing and reaping seasons.
    They evidently only see six stars in the latter, as they call them
    <i>Tshimtanatu</i>, which means anything containing six.</p>

  <p>They believe the sun returns across the sky at night when everyone is
    sleeping, and that it travels from west to east ready to start over
    again at daybreak, but high up in the expanse of the heavens and hidden
    from sight by unseen clouds. They ridicule the idea of the earth being
    round.</p>

  <p>Eclipses of the sun or moon foretell war or some other great calamity.
    They most usually say of them that the sun or moon is “rotten,”
    frequently that they are “sick.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

  <p>They generally believe that each moon dies, and that every new moon
    is <em>new</em> in the strict sense of the word. Some, however, think that
    it does not die altogether, but leaves a seed or germ, which in turn
    grows big and then small until only the seed is left. The rising and
    setting of the Pleiades, the new and full moon, are occasions of great
    rejoicings, dancing, and beer-drinking.</p>

  <p>Sacrifices are still made by local natives. Formerly a large number
    of black oxen were killed at one sacrifice, but since the scourge of
    rinderpest visited Rhodesia goats have been substituted. The last
    sacrifice at Zimbabwe took place in February, 1904. The local natives
    sacrificed in the Elliptical Temple, but they have no settled point
    within the temple where they hold these ceremonies. The sacrifice was
    conducted during the prolonged drought then prevailing. The natives
    kept the ceremony private until after it was over, and the rain had
    arrived.</p>

  <p>Makalanga of several tribes from near and far used to come to the
    Elliptical Temple for sacrifices, and these were offered up within the
    walls, but at different spots inside; while on several occasions the
    ceremony took place just outside the walls. Once every village had
    its own ceremony, and these took place in January, black bulls being
    offered for males and black cows for females.</p>

  <p>The sacrifices now made are to the spirits of departed chiefs, and are
    offered on the suggestion of witch-doctors, who receive fees for their
    advice, and who, to make money, declare that the spirit of some dead
    chief or relative is angry and must be appeased. Some portion of the
    meat was taken to the spot supposed to be haunted by the spirit, and
    the rest is eaten by those present, the bones being sometimes burnt or
    thrown into a river; but recently they have been left about the spot.
    Sacrifices were usually offered to secure success in any venture to be
    undertaken, or to obtain good harvests. Till recently they practised a
    similar rite to that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> known in Mosaic times, and in this instance also
    the animal was not killed, but was led out on to the veld and purposely
    lost. If found it was not killed. The natives are aware that this rite
    was once observed by their people, but state it is not practised now.</p>

  <p>The Makalanga undoubtedly believe in the immortality of the soul, but
    they have very vague ideas as to a future life beyond a thorough faith
    in the transmigration of souls. They do not conceive the existence of
    a Creator or Supreme Being, their highest conception being <i>M’uali</i>, a
    spirit, who can make their crops a failure and their herds sick, and
    to this spirit they offer sacrifices. The <i>M’uali</i>, judging by native
    account, is not in any way an ennobling spirit, and they are constantly
    in dread of him. The witch-doctors in order to acquire wealth for
    themselves interpret the wishes of the <i>M’uali</i> in the light of their
    own purposes and interests.</p>

  <p>With regard to burials the customs, even among the Makalanga, vary
    considerably. In some instances the bodies are laid lengthwise and on
    the left side facing the north. This seems to have been the original
    custom of these people, but it is not now a general one. Burial in
    a sitting position is very commonly met with. On the Acropolis,
    during the preservation work (1902–3), about fifty Makalanga graves
    were found, and the remains in a score of instances were removed.
    Practically all were in a sitting position, only three having been
    buried lengthways. These were discovered in entrances and passages, the
    bodies having been laid on the surface, soil and stones, taken from the
    nearest wall, placed round and over them. None of these were very old,
    and most were Mogabe’s people. Their bark hunting-nets, assegais, pots,
    and other personal belongings, were placed on the top of the grave, and
    not inside with the corpse.</p>

  <p>The Baduma, who live in Gutu’s country, and also the Barotse, still
    embalm or, rather, dry the bodies of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span> chiefs, and also the dead
    of certain families, though generally the bodies are buried lengthways
    on their right side, facing the sun. The body is placed in the hut
    on a bier made of poles near a large fire, and continually turned,
    any blisters which may appear being carefully broken, until the body
    is dry. Then it is wrapped up in a blanket and hung from the roof.
    Annual sacrifices are made to the spirits, and the bodies are regularly
    visited and kept in order by a person appointed for that work. The
    rain-makers, who live on the Sabi, also dry their dead.</p>

  <p>The manufactures of the Makalanga are fast declining. In very rare
    instances may be found villages where bark and cotton are still woven.
    Limbo from the stores is so cheap and attractive looking that it has
    practically driven out the local article, and the clay whorls used in
    spinning cotton are now discarded. Their once famous iron and copper
    smelting industries almost disappeared on the advent of cheap and
    substantial tools. At one time every village had its blacksmith and
    its furnaces and forges, but during the last few years iron-working
    has become far less general. Derembghe, near Mr. Nolan’s farm, in the
    Victoria district, is the only representative of the old industry.
    Pottery is still made, but at Chikwanda, near Arowi and east of
    Zimbabwe, the people make pottery of a superior quality. This is also
    the case at Mazuwa’s, in Nini district.</p>

  <p>The people are essentially a race of agriculturists and cattle
    breeders, and dislike working in mines. Though they are most
    industrious in their own plantations, yet they will not work for a
    white man for more than a month or two in a year, preferring to spend
    the rest of the year in absolute idleness. Many are adepts in brass or
    copper wire-work, with which they adorn their sticks and weapons. They
    are also very skilful in wood-carving, basket-making, and in tanning
    and preparing skins.</p>

  <p>The Makalanga of this district are certainly above the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span> average
    type of natives in the possession of both intellectual and physical
    qualifications. Light skins, Semitic noses, fine features, with an
    absence of high cheek-bones, small, well-shaped hands—are frequent
    features met with among them. The men, who wear but insignificant
    aprons, are well proportioned, are as straight as an arrow, and have
    athletic figures. Large turquoise-blue beads of glass form the neck
    ornament of men, women, and children in this district, and these
    contrast effectively with the colour and polish of their skins. Both
    men and women frequently wear a narrow band of pink and white beads
    round their heads. Brass bangles are worn on wrists, arms, legs, and
    ankles, the women and girls wearing these in great profusion.</p>

  <p>Women are bare to the low hips, and wear a short skin skirt reaching
    almost to the knees. This is most generally adorned with chevron
    pattern of pink and white beads. Their stomachs are covered with two
    sets of lines worked into the flesh, one set under each breast. This
    pattern is very general here, and is identical with the “breast and
    furrow” pattern found not only on the fronts of the clay furnaces,
    pillows, drums, and granaries, but on the ancient relics and sacred
    emblems (phalli) discovered in the ruins. Bent and other writers
    believe that these flesh-markings are a survival of the occult idea
    of Fertility. There are generally about thirty rows of these lines or
    cicatrices, and their regularity is most surprising.</p>

  <p>The men are practically bare-skinned, and have their waists, shoulders,
    and sometimes each side of their foreheads, marked with a row of bars
    in threes, thus: <span class="large"><b>/|\ /|\</b></span>, and these closely resemble
    the sign of Light as seen in the Welsh bardic symbol. These, many
    natives state, are luck signs, and they would not be without them, for
    with them on their skin they believe they shall always be healthy and
    strong and have many wives and children. Other natives state that the
    flesh-markings on the men’s bodies are but <span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>ornaments to attract
    the attentions of women, while others assert they only bear the marks
    because it is a custom. Each male has a forelock, some of these being
    erect and others pendent, the latter being usually threaded with pink
    and white beads. These often reach below the eyes. They are very proud
    of their forelocks, and will spend most of their spare time in trying
    to pull them out longer.</p>

  <p>Witchcraft still possesses a tremendous influence over the native mind,
    although the practice of it is punished by imprisonment, but it is most
    difficult to obtain evidences in most cases of offence. Before the
    country was occupied by the British the witch-doctors practically ruled
    the people, and their influence in many known instances was greater
    than that of dynastic chiefs. The inclination of the people is to
    revert to the old practices, and fear of punishment alone prevents them
    doing so. There is no doubt that some of the infanticides and murders
    happening to-day are the results of witch-doctors’ machinations.</p>

  <p>Though every native appears to have a good idea of medicine and of
    the uses of certain herbs and roots, and to be able to cure simple
    complaints, yet the remedies for more serious matters are in the
    hands of the medicine-men, who keep all such knowledge to their own
    profession.</p>

  <p>A rain-maker for a large present would, until recently, kill a child of
    one of his many wives, and as long as the mother mourned for her child
    the rain was supposed to continue.</p>

  <p>The Makalanga undoubtedly possess a keener appreciation of music
    and singing than many of the other native races in this part of the
    continent. When at work, digging, hoeing, or threshing, they sing
    continually, and in one morning they will spontaneously render fully a
    dozen different songs and a large number of extempore recitatives and
    choruses interspersed, also a few part-songs and catches. They sing
    going to and returning from labour, and always sing at their work, and
    when they cease singing one may be certain they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span> idling. There is
    far greater harmony and variety of music produced from their pianos,
    and their songs are brighter and more spirited, than any music or song
    a Matabele can evolve, and the dreary monotonous chant of the latter
    is almost entirely absent. The subjects of their songs are numerous,
    and comprise many items which only a people who live face to face
    with Nature could sing without offending the decencies as regarded by
    civilised people, and in these songs the smallest child most lustily
    joins. They will sing impromptu songs having reference to the tools
    they happen to be using, or to anything they may chance to see. The
    Native Commissioner is a great subject of their songs. They have
    war-songs, lullabies, songs to the bride, to the child just able to
    walk, to the new moon, to the butter they are making, besides a number
    of children’s songs.</p>

  <p>They also have a large number of proverbs which somewhat resemble those
    employed at Home, thus:—</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

  <p>The natives can make fire (<i>sika</i>) very easily. The woods usually
    selected for this purpose are <i>Zumbani</i> and <i>Bg̊ebg̊a</i>. One piece
    is rounded, and the lower point is inserted in a small hole in the
    other wood, and then twirled with the palms of the hands round rapidly
    till sparks are emitted, and then very dry grass is placed at the
    bottom of the rounded stick, when it will light. Should the wood be
    slightly damp, a very small pinch of sand is placed in the hole to
    increase the friction. The <i>sika</i> sticks can obtain fire almost as
    quickly as can a magnifying glass.</p>

  <p>On felling a tree in clearing a plantation it is a general custom in
    this district for the native to make a small ring of grass and lay it
    on the tree stump, and then to spit on the ring and to cover it with a
    large stone. Natives state, in explanation of this practice, that their
    people have always done it, but they cannot say for what purpose.</p>

  <p>The pottery whorls found in very old native huts are known to many
    natives, but not to all, for the author has heard natives explaining
    their purpose to other natives. These whorls had sticks inserted
    top-fashion through the centre hole, and were spun rapidly between the
    hands. These were used for drawing the threads from the mass of cotton,
    also, some say, in producing fire. The children find them and use them
    for tops. The whorls which are found in ruins, and which are doubtless
    antique, are made of soapstone and are excellently finished.</p>

  <p>The natives decorate the wooden doors of their huts, also the interior
    walls—check pattern being general for this purpose. The best decoration
    of doors is to be found in Gutu’s and Chibi’s districts.</p>

  <p>The native name for Victoria is <i>Duruben</i>, or <i>Durubeni</i>, sometimes
    <i>Vitori</i>. <i>Duruben</i> is derived from the Dutch word <i>dorp</i>, and <i>Vitori</i>
    is an attempt to pronounce Victoria. <i>Campeni</i> is the name of the old
    township of Victoria, which used to be known as The Camp. Several
    isolated settle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>ments of white people towards the south are called by
    the natives of those districts <i>Durubeni</i>, the termination being that
    of the locative case. The hillock in Victoria, near the gaol, used to
    be called “<i>Gòna Zhon</i>” (“They failed to capture the elephant”). The
    open veld about Victoria was called “<i>Bani ro moteio</i>” (“The plain
    without trees”).</p>

  <p>The salutation <i>Moro!</i> or <i>Morra!</i> employed by the natives is simply
    a corruption of the Dutch word <i>Morgen!</i> <i>i.e.</i> Good Morning! In Cape
    Dutch <i>Morrè!</i> is used, and from this the word <i>Morro!</i> was evidently
    derived. The natives agree in stating that it is a Dutch word brought
    into the country by Dutch hunters and Cape Boys long before the
    British arrived. They ridicule all idea of its being of native origin,
    and state that in some districts it is not used. The practice of
    handshaking on meeting is one which the natives state has been copied
    from the white men.</p>

  <p>The salute on meeting is by clapping hands. On greeting a man they will
    clap the palms with the hands slightly crossed, the forefinger of the
    right hand crossing the base of the forefinger of the other; but on
    saluting a woman the forefinger is placed to forefinger with wrists
    together. The length of time of clapping depends on the position of the
    person saluted. On joining a group to talk, eat, or drink the new-comer
    claps hands before sitting down and again when the food or drink is
    offered him.</p>

  <p>Among the Jewish customs of the Makalanga the following may be
    noticed. (1) Monotheism and no worship of idols; (2) worship of, and
    sacrifices to, ancestors—a practice condemned by the Prophets; (3)
    rite of circumcision; (4) despising the uncircumcised: the taunt
    of non-circumcision is commonly employed between disputants; (5)
    purification and shaving of the head; (6) transferring impurity or
    infection from individuals to some animal, which in some instances
    is slain and in others purposely lost on the veld; (7) reception by
    women of parties returning from hunting or war, as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span> the case of
    Jephthah; (8) feasts of new moons and invocations to new moons; (9)
    feasts of full moons; (10) offerings of first fruits; (11) defilement
    by touching the dead; (12) defilement of eating flesh containing blood;
    (13) abhorrence of swine as unclean; (14) sprinkling the worshippers
    with blood; (15) places of refuge for criminals or people believed
    but not found guilty of offending tribal custom;<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> (16) observance
    of Sabbath, either every five or seven days; (17) marriage only among
    themselves, but cannot marry into the same tribe; (18) casting of lots;
    (19) sacrifices of oxen in times of trouble, such as drought; (20)
    practice of espousal before marriage; (21) brother succeeds to brother
    in office and property; (22) brother takes to wife the wives of his
    deceased elder brother, and raising offspring, they rank in office as
    if they were the children of the deceased; (23) a daughter does not
    inherit property or position except on the death of all her brothers;
    (24) rigid morality with regard to all fleshly sins, adultery and
    fornication being punished with death and outlawry.</p>

  <p>Additional parallelisms with Jewish customs could be stated, and all
    these peculiar practices, together with the lighter skin and the Jewish
    appearance of the Makalanga, distinctly point to the ancient impress of
    the Idumean Jews, which can also be traced on the present peoples of
    Madagascar and of the coasts of Mozambique and Sofala.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

  <p>Many of these customs are now falling into desuetude on the advance of
    white civilisation. The Molembo tribe of Makalanga is noted for the
    preservation and observance of the majority of these Jewish practices,
    which are in character distinctly pre-Koranic in origin.</p>

  <h3>1. SOAPSTONE ARTICLES</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap">SIR JOHN LUBBOCK once observed that one antiquarian relic found by
    itself was no testimony as to any particular ancient occupation of
    the spot at which it was discovered, but that the discovery of many
    identical relics in one place, and under identical conditions, might be
    considered as evidence of such occupation. Single specimens are known
    to have been transported from one hemisphere to another during the
    course of three or four thousand years.</p>

  <p>At Great Zimbabwe it is not, except in a few instances, with single
    relics that we have to deal, but with those found in tens and scores,
    practically in identical and corresponding locations, and under
    exactly similar conditions. So regularly are these relics situated on
    certain floors that, with a few exceptions explained later, one is
    always certain as to the class of relics which will be met with on any
    particular floor which is being cleared. Of course, these relics and
    “finds” are not distributed generally on their respective floors, and
    frequently the realisation of one’s hopes of meeting with them were
    greatly deferred, while on other occasions half an hour’s work yielded
    them in quantities. Still, when <span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>once found, they were generally
    abundant—at least, on those floors that were expected to yield them.</p>

  </div>

  <p>A small quantity of articles having claim to some antiquity were found
    out of relative position to the bulk of similar relics. For instance,
    phalli, which were found in quantities on certain floors in the eastern
    half only of the Elliptical Temple, also at the Eastern and Western
    Temples on the hill, and at Philips Ruins in the Valley of Ruins, have,
    in some few instances, been found singly, but most frequently fractured
    or damaged, in positions which could not have been those occupied by
    any of the ancient inhabitants. Single specimens are sometimes found in
    the débris piles immediately outside the entrances to the three temples
    and Philips Ruins. Those found lower in such piles were no doubt thrown
    out by old native peoples who would not be aware of their purpose. Some
    of these have been converted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span> into amulets or charms, while others are
    known to have been used for making <i>daha</i> (hemp) pipe-bowls. Those
    phalli found in the higher portions of such débris piles are shown
    by the stratification of the débris to have been brought out by the
    numerous relic hunters by whom the excavated soil from the interiors
    was deposited on these débris heaps outside. This experience extends
    also to almost all the more antique relics found at Zimbabwe.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <i>phalli</i> found at Zimbabwe must now amount to at least one hundred,
    of which more than half have been found recently. It is very probable
    that on further examination of the lower floors of these four ruins
    other specimens will be met with. The phalli found vary in size and
    design. The largest (Pl. I., fig. 6) stood 7½ in. high, was perfectly
    plain, but highly polished. The smallest were seven-eighths of an
    inch long, but each had its base bevelled and a ring carved round the
    summit. Except where the base is fractured, all stand erect on any
    tolerably flat surface. The bases show signs of extensive scratchings,
    as if they had been constantly moved. The average heights of the
    phalli are from two to four inches. Round the bases of many of the
    recently discovered phalli are small bevels, sometimes in two circles.
    The majority were unadorned, but their identity was unmistakable. The
    more ornate specimens bore the “female breast and furrow” pattern,
    one had chevron pattern round its bevelled base, several showed the
    circumcisional markings, and on the top of one (Pl. I., figs. 12 and
    13) were carved in relief rosettes formed of a circle completely
    surrounded by eight small circles, the latter a pattern which is
    frequently found on soapstone beams and bowls, and is also used to form
    the eyes of one of the soapstone birds found at Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p>Worked and decorated <em>soapstone beams</em> have been found only in four
    localities within the ruins’ area, viz. (1) the Elliptical Temple, on
    the summit and at the bases of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>main east and south-east wall
    within the limits of the chevron pattern; (2) also in quantities on
    the summit and at the base of the circular granite cement platform
    which lies to the north of the Conical Tower; (3) on the summit and
    at the bases of the north wall of the Western Temple on the hill; (4)
    on the summit and at the bases of the arc wall of the Eastern Temple,
    decorated with dentelle pattern and facing east; (5) on or near the two
    granite cement platforms in the interior, and on the site of Mr. Bent’s
    “altar,” also in the same temple; and (6) on the summit and at the
    bases of the arc wall facing east at Philips Ruins, the fragments of
    beams found at this latter place being exceedingly numerous. Splinters
    of soapstone beams are found in the soil in the larger ruins, showing
    that some of the beams fell from their position and became fractured
    after the filling in with soil which took place at least one hundred
    and fifty years ago. Few, if any, worked soapstone beams were found in
    any of the Valley Ruins, save at Philips. All beams have been worked,
    and the marks of the tools and their sizes can still be seen on many;
    some are also carved, the chevron pattern predominating.</p>

  <p>A portion of a soapstone beam, 2 ft. 6 in. long and 1 ft. 5 in. in
    circumference, formed part of what is known to have been a very tall
    and slender pillar, which was once surmounted by a bird. This stood on
    the north wall of the Western Temple on the Acropolis, and was found
    in 1902. The beam is completely covered with most delicately carved
    chevron pattern.</p>

  <p>A carved soapstone beam, 11 ft. high, which showed signs of once being
    taller, stood on the platform of the Western Temple on the Acropolis.
    It fell about 1890, and broke into two parts, and these Mr. Bent
    removed.</p>

  <p>A section of a soapstone beam (Pl. I., fig. 3), carved into rounds
    resembling a chain of connected balls and decorated with spiral lines,
    was found in No. 15 Enclosure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span> of the Elliptical Temple, on the lowest
    floor and 2 ft. below the foundation of the north-east wall of that
    enclosure.</p>

  <p>A curiously carved piece of soapstone (Pl. I., fig. 2), evidently a
    portion of a beam, was found close to the circular platform in the
    Platform Area at the Elliptical Temple, among the numerous soapstone
    beams found at some depth at that spot. The fragment has so broken that
    it resembles a slipper with a band across the instep. The whole face of
    it is covered with small raised circular knobs.</p>

  <p>Eight carved <em>soapstone birds</em> and <em>birds on beams</em><a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> are known to
    have been removed from the ruins prior to 1902, and they were mostly
    found on the Acropolis. Two, it is known, were taken to Johannesburg
    in 1890, and about the same time the lower portion of a bird (of which
    the upper portion was found by the author in 1902) was removed and sold
    to Mr. Rhodes. In 1891 Mr. Bent removed four birds on beams and also
    the lower portion of another bird, but he did not discover any of them,
    as the position of all these was well known to settlers both before
    the occupation and previously to this visit, many attempts having been
    made to buy these relics from the Mogabe Chipfuno, who persistently
    refused to part with them. These four birds on beams and another beam
    on which had once been a bird were standing more or less erect and
    fixed in granite cement on the Eastern Temple on the Acropolis, which
    for years previously had been used as a cattle kraal, and the holes and
    places in which they once stood, and from which Mr. Bent removed them,
    can be seen to-day. But on the authority of very early visitors, and
    of the Mogabe Handisibishe, there are still two birds unaccounted for.
    Possibly the mention of this fact may lead to their recovery. There
    is a general belief that one of these birds is in a certain museum in
    Austria, and this is quite possible, seeing that at least two Austrian
    scientists have visited this <span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>country. The total number of birds
    known to have been found at Zimbabwe prior to 1902 was eight.</p>

    <div class="caption">FRONT, SIDE AND BACK VIEWS OF SOAPSTONE BIRD, ZIMBABWE</div>
  </div>

  <p>In 1902–3 the author unearthed the upper portion of the fractured bird
    (Pl. I., fig. 1), the lower portion of which was found on the Acropolis
    in 1890, together with a section of the beam upon which it once stood.
    The head, neck, and shoulders of this bird are 9½ in. long. Up the
    neck, front, and back is a carved protruding rib. This portion of the
    bird is in an extremely good state of preservation, and the carving
    shows more artistic skill than do any of the birds on beams in the Cape
    Town Museum.</p>

  <p>In 1903 the author discovered the tenth carved soapstone bird on
    beam. This was found in Philips Ruins, the most interesting buildings
    outside the Acropolis and Elliptical Temple. The bird and beam, which
    are still intact, were found on the east side of a high and massive
    wall and at the south side of a small conical tower in the North-East
    Enclosure of these ruins, being buried in soil and block débris to a
    depth of 3 ft. It was upside down, with the base resting against the
    side of the cone, from the summit of which it most probably had fallen,
    as the cone, which is approached by two steps and a platform on its
    east side, was covered with granite cement, while the base of the beam
    bears marks of its having once stood embedded in granite cement. All
    the birds at Zimbabwe found standing, with one exception, had the bases
    of the beams fixed in excellent granite cement. This bird and beam are
    undoubtedly not only in the best state of preservation of any yet found
    at Zimbabwe, but show evidence of more artistic workmanship having been
    bestowed upon them than any of those previously discovered. Up the face
    of the beam is carved a crocodile 16 in. long, and round the <i>cestus</i>
    beneath the bird’s feet, which is 3 in. deep, is carved work—on one
    side a large double row of chevron pattern, similar to the pattern
    on the east wall of the Elliptical Temple, and on the opposite side
    a single row of chevron, surmounted by two large em<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>bossed circular
    discs; the back edge of the beam is plain, and the front edge above the
    crocodile has two small embossed circular discs. The bird stands 11
    in. high, the total height of the beam and bird being 5 ft. 5 in., its
    width 8 in. on the flat sides, and 2½ in. on its end edges.</p>

  <p><em>Miniature soapstone birds</em> on pedestals have been found by other
    explorers of Zimbabwe, but the writer discovered only a portion of one
    of such birds.</p>

  <p>In Mr. Bent’s work are given the opinions of several of the best-known
    scientists of Europe, who, by means of the birds and associated relics
    found at Zimbabwe, connect the worship carried on there with that of
    the ancient Sabæan people of South Arabia, who worshipped the goddess
    Almaquah (Venus), the Morning Star. See Preface, also pages 181–87 of
    <cite>The Ruined Cities of Mashonaland</cite>.</p>

  <p>The best-made <em>soapstone bowls</em> are found on the lower granite cement
    floors of the ruins and far below any native clay floors, the southern
    side of the Acropolis, the eastern half of the Elliptical Temple, and
    Philips Ruins yielding these in quantities. The fragments of bowls
    with carved processions of horned animals, of which a dozen pieces
    have recently been discovered, and which fragments represent different
    sized bowls, were found only on the lowest floors, and these only on
    the Acropolis. This was also the experience of Mr. Bent. But there is
    an exception to this rule, viz. that the ancients, or some people of
    a period prior to the Makalanga, had, on the bowls becoming broken,
    thrown the fragments over the west and south edges of the Acropolis
    Hill, where fragments may still be found among and under the wall
    débris which has fallen down the precipitous sides of the hill.
    Probably before these fragments became, at a later date, completely
    covered by further falls of wall débris, native people of a remote age
    converted some of these into slabs for the <i>isafuba</i> game, and cut the
    sets of game-holes on their flat bases and on the inside of the higher
    rims, while they <span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>have also rudely scratched the usual native designs
    on the opposite side to the carving—crude designs which are obviously
    in striking contrast to the artistic work of the original makers of the
    bowl. Such portions, and but a few only, have been found on very old
    native clay floors on the Acropolis.</p>

    <div class="caption">FRONT AND SIDE VIEWS OF SOAPSTONE BIRD ON BEAM,
      DISCOVERED BY AUTHOR AT PHILIPS’ RUINS, ZIMBABWE, IN 1893</div>
  </div>

  <p>The fragments of the soapstone bowls recently found vary in style,
    size, and carving, and these fragments represent at least thirty
    different bowls. Mr. Bent also found fragments representing some ten
    different bowls, and as there still remain large areas of lower floors
    to be opened out, there may be still further evidences of even more
    extensive use of these articles by the ancients of all periods at
    Zimbabwe. The diameters, judged by the radii of the segments, vary
    from 1 ft. 1½ in., which is the smallest size yet found, to 1 ft. 3¾
    in., the largest so far discovered. The heights of the outside of the
    rims range from 2 in. to 3½ in., the majority being about 2¾ in. The
    rims, which are all without flange, except in one instance, are from
    1⅛ in. to 1⅝ in. in thickness. The bases of the bowls have about the
    same average thickness, but in a few cases they are somewhat thinner.
    The insides of the bowls from rim to rim are always beautifully flat
    and smooth. The bottoms are thickly covered with fine scratches, as if
    the bowls had been constantly pushed along the top of stone or fine
    cement work. The insides of some of the bowls show signs of having been
    subjected to very great heat previously to the breaking of the article.
    It may well be imagined that bowls of these dimensions, cut out of
    solid soapstone, itself an exceedingly heavy stone, must have been of
    great weight, and that without considering any contents they might have
    held.</p>

  <p>A few bowls only were plain—that is, with no decorative pattern on the
    outside—though all are finely worked, and the plainest has rounded
    sides which slightly project at the top of the rim. The designs on the
    relics vary, and include procession of horned animals (Pl. I., fig.
    4), zebras, dogs, a bird,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span> and a man. The decorations on the majority
    of the bowls comprise (1) herring-bone, plain; (2) herring-bone on
    cords, <i>i.e.</i> two parallel cords with their respective lines of strands
    inclining opposite ways, and thus together forming a herring-bone
    pattern; (3) cord pattern, the strands of the parallel cords both
    inclining in the same direction. These cords in (2) and (3) are found
    both vertically and horizontally. In the case of cord pattern of any
    sort the cords are carved in lengths, the lengths being divided by
    plain protruding squares at intervals; (4) circular discs sunk into
    the surface, the discs being either plain or covered with rings within
    rings till the centre is reached; (5) a chain of diamond-shaped panels
    with centres completely filled up with lines parallel to the outer
    lines.</p>

  <p>A pattern (6) (Pl. I., fig. 5), new in Zimbabwe relics, was recently
    found on the rim of a soapstone bowl discovered in Maund Ruins in
    the Valley of Ruins. This consists of two wave bands crossing and
    recrossing each other throughout their length, and thus making a
    continuous line of perfect circles. This is very correctly carved, and
    the artistic merit of its workmanship is equal, if not superior, to
    that of any soapstone relic yet found at Zimbabwe.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

  <p>Among other soapstone “finds” made recently at these ruins are two
    fragments of two <em>double claw-hammer-shaped ingot moulds</em> (Pl. I.,
    figs. 7 and 8), each fragment being the major portion of such mould.
    These were cut into the broken section of an ornamented beam. Moulds of
    this shape are not, therefore, necessarily ancient, though the form may
    have been handed down from ancient times. Mr. Selous, some years ago,
    discovered considerable quantities of copper ingot moulds in actual use
    by the natives of Katanga, and these were almost the identical shape of
    the ingot mould discovered by Mr. Bent at Zimbabwe. The Administrator
    of North-Eastern Rhodesia reported in March, 1900, that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>ingots of
    copper in the form of a St. Andrew’s Cross were common articles of
    trade in the Katanga district. It must also be recollected that three
    such ingots have been found in Southern Rhodesia. Though old, their
    appearance does not in any instance suggest antiquity. The author,
    taking these points into consideration, does not believe that the ingot
    mould discovered by Mr. Bent can be any evidence of the occupation of
    this country by the Phœnicians, and this opinion is further confirmed
    by the locations of the moulds found. (See <cite>The Ancient Ruins of
    Rhodesia</cite>, pages 128 and 141; also Appendix thereto, <a href="#NOTE_C">Note C</a>.)</p>

  <p>A straight <em>bar mould</em> (Pl. I., fig. 9) which shows signs of
    considerable use has also been found, but on an upper clay floor. It
    is believed that this was used for moulding copper bars. The natives
    of Kafue, the Molembo people of modern times, and the local Barotse,
    all these being races of skilful copper workers, are known to have made
    identically shaped copper bars.</p>

  <p>Other soapstone articles include a <em>ball</em>, a few <em>whorls</em>, <em>amulets</em>,
    and <em>daha pipe-bowls</em>, the latter being of Makalanga make, while it
    would be extremely difficult to say to which period the other articles
    belonged.</p>

  <h3>2. GOLD ARTICLES<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></h3>

  <p><em>Gold</em> in almost every form has been found in quantities on several
    of the lower floors of the ruins, and from its locations must have
    been produced and worked, not only by ancients, but by very old Kafir
    people, possibly under Moslem Arab supervision, for concave fragments
    of Kafir pottery of a very far back period (and so pronounced by
    Dr. Hahn and other experts) have been used as crude <em>scorifiers</em>,
    and the gold can still be seen on them in the flux, while other
    undoubted Kafir remains, some of which are claimed to be Makalanga of
    an exceedingly old make, are found associated with the scorifiers.
    The mediæval Makalanga, as early Portuguese records show, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>not only
    produced gold but manufactured it, especially into gold wire. It may be
    conjectured that this style of metal work was due to Arab influence,
    for the earliest Portuguese records frequently testify that the Arabs
    possessed important colonies in the country of the Monomotapa, colonies
    sufficiently influential to mould the policy of successive Monomotapas,
    especially as against the incursion of Portuguese, and that the main
    purpose of the Arab intruders in the country was to obtain gold
    and ivory. Until the last decade, when the cheap and ready-made
    European goods became obtainable by the natives, the Makalanga can be
    conclusively shown to have been a nation of metal smiths capable of
    producing most excellent work, and of drawing very fine wire, while
    to-day their art of making wire bangles and covering articles with work
    in correct patterns is such that the difference between the quality of
    the native work and that produced by machinery in Europe can hardly be
    detected. It must be remembered, too, that previously to, and for some
    time after, the occupation, it was possible to buy gold beads from the
    natives in Mashonaland. These might to a large extent have been found
    in ancient ruins, but the majority of such articles so bartered for
    from the natives consisted of Kafir-made copper and iron bangles with
    gold beads at intervals round the circle.</p>

  <p>Gold and gold articles of the more delicate and artistic manufacture
    belong mainly to the period of the ancients, but gold, as shown by
    tradition, history, and “finds,” was also a product of mediæval
    Makalanga, as can be further demonstrated by any excavator of very old
    Makalanga floors, and of this the proofs exist abundantly.</p>

  <p>The small <em>gold crucibles</em> of granite clay similar to those described
    on page 221 of Mr. Bent’s work, and found on the lowest floors and in
    rock holes and fissures used for depositing débris, where they must
    have been thrown away as rubbish after the small cakes of gold had been
    removed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span> although they still contained in the flux large beady pieces
    of gold. A large number of these have been found in positions where the
    Kafir clay scorifiers are not met with. It would be well in considering
    the “finds” of crucibles not to treat them with the pottery gold
    scorifiers, for, so far as discoveries lead, they undoubtedly appear to
    belong to entirely different ages.</p>

  <p>Several sizes of <em>gold beads</em> have been found. There is no doubt that
    some places in certain enclosures of the older ruins will yield a fair
    quantity when the soil on the lower floors is systematically treated.
    Several beads are perfectly round, others are round but with flat ends,
    others again show two facets encircling them and meeting at the widest
    point.</p>

  <p><em>Beaten gold</em> to the amount of about 6 ozs. was found on the lower
    floors. This was discovered in the form of plates usually about 1½
    in. to 2 in. by 1 in., each plate having small holes round the edges,
    in many of which holes the gold tacks still remained. One piece was
    wider at one end than at the other, and this is believed to have been a
    sheathing encircling a section of a piece of ebony found with it, the
    ebony stick being thick at the top and tapered towards the end. There
    were remains of embossed designs on two pieces of beaten gold, one of
    diamond pattern and the other a plain circle with curved radiating
    marks.</p>

  <p><em>Gold tacks</em> were most usually found with the beaten gold. These are of
    microscopic size. The majority have wedged-shaped heads, and the others
    flattened heads. It is believed that these tacks served to fasten the
    gold sheathing on to wooden articles used by the ancients.</p>

  <p><em>Bar-gold</em> and <em>gold-cake</em> were found on the lowest floors in the
    Elliptical Temple and North-East Passage respectively. <em>Gold dust</em> is
    found in certain enclosures only, but on the lowest floors. Over two
    hundred pannings of the soil in various enclosures have been made. The
    soil of some enclosures is absolutely destitute of any trace of gold,
    so also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span> is the veld soil brought into the ruins by native people over
    one hundred and fifty years ago. In some places outside the ruins
    pannings show gold, and pieces of beaten gold and gold wire have been
    found in such places.</p>

  <p>One complete <em>gold bangle</em> of twisted wire, most artistically wrought
    and weighing 2½ ozs., was found on the bed-rock in an enclosure on the
    Acropolis Hill. Another complete gold bangle was found on the lowest
    floor of No. 15 Enclosure of the Elliptical Temple. Short pieces of
    twisted gold wire of various gauges have been found at several ruins.
    Most of such pieces are parts of broken bangles.</p>

  <p><em>Gold scorifiers</em> of native pottery were found in quantities on an
    intermediate floor in No. 6 Enclosure of the Elliptical Temple,
    together with a pair of iron pincers and Arabian glass. The report made
    by Dr. P. Daniel Hahn, <span class="smcap">ph. d.</span>, <span class="smcap">m.a.</span>, Professor of
    Chemistry, South African Chemical and Metallurgical Laboratory, Cape
    Town, on these scorifiers, is as follows:—</p>

  <p>“The several fragments of scorifiers sent for analysis did not
    all contain sufficient flux to be removed without being mixed
    up with the substance of the scorifier. A fair quantity of flux

  <h3>3. COPPER ARTICLES</h3>

  <p>Discoveries of copper in several forms are made on intermediate and
    higher levels. So far no copper article has been found by any explorer
    at Zimbabwe which could be claimed as being ancient, though doubtless
    the ancients worked also in copper, and it is quite probable that
    copper articles made in pre-Kafir times may yet be found. Such copper
    articles as have been found show a decided Kafir form, the copper
    battle-axes and barbed spearheads, bangles, beads, and wire-work
    closely resembling the iron articles still made by the natives,
    though of a somewhat superior design and make, and some of these in
    all probability, judging by their location and the associated finds,
    covered a period extending from mediæval times until comparatively a
    few years ago. The floors and immediate vicinity of native huts of
    the oldest construction yield copper articles abundantly, while later
    native floors have a larger percentage of iron articles.</p>

  <p>Three pounds’ weight of thin and narrow strips of <em>copper sheathing</em>
    with tack-holes round the edges and copper tacks were found on one of
    the higher levels, and at a depth of several feet below were granite
    cement steps and buttresses of excellent construction. This sheathing
    had evidently covered some wooden article.</p>

  <p>The copper used in most instances is pronounced to be pure metal and
    free from the usual alloys. The metal in these is of so pliable a
    nature that <em>spearheads</em> can be easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span> twisted by hand into almost any
    shape. One spearhead was copper and tin, but the latter was present
    in very small proportion. Several articles once thought to be bronze
    are now pronounced to be of copper only. A small piece of a bar of
    tin was found on an intermediate floor. <em>Copper wire</em>, mostly in the
    form of bangles, is very plentiful on intermediate floors, also large
    <em>cakes of copper</em> and <em>copper slag</em>, but so far the actual remains of
    copper-smelting furnaces <i>in situ</i> have not been met with at Zimbabwe,
    though judging by the amount of copper slag and <em>copper ore</em> found at
    the extreme east of the Acropolis ruins, copper-smelting was carried
    on in that locality during the period when the gold scorifiers made
    of native pottery were being used. Here were found portions of clay
    <em>cupolas</em> which had been used for copper-smelting, circular and deep,
    about the size of a small teacup. The fine and delicate <em>copper chain</em>
    found in Renders Ruins is believed to be of Arab origin, and used to
    suspend the lamp-holder found with it. Pieces of a small <em>copper box</em>,
    and several solidly made <em>copper bangles</em>, and <em>copper finger-rings</em>
    in snake form with the extremities coiled, were also found in Renders
    Ruins on the same level where the copper chain and several articles of
    Arab origin were discovered.</p>

  <h3>4. IRON ARTICLES</h3>

  <p>Objects made of iron are found in all floors, but mainly on
    intermediate and upper floors. Makalanga iron tools, ornaments,
    weapons, and iron slag are found in great profusion on the upper
    floors, especially in the black surface mould and among grass and shrub
    roots. Modern native-made <em>iron hoes</em> are as a rule without any sign
    of bevel to strengthen the blade, but iron hoes with a peculiar bevel
    down the centre of the blade on both sides are found among native
    articles of a rather superior character and at slightly lower depths.
    These latter have a depression stamped down the centre of the blade
    which raises a bevel on the opposite <span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>face, while on the opposite
    side another depression has been stamped parallel with the raised
    bevel on that side, thus providing a rib on each face, which greatly
    strengthens the hoe. This class of bevel has been pronounced by experts
    to be an old form employed also in other parts of the world, and local
    authorities on Makalanga iron-work assign this make of hoe to several
    generations ago, while the Makalanga themselves state that such hoes
    are found in very old deserted villages of their people, but have not
    been made during their time, but used to be so made by their fathers’
    fathers.</p>

    <div class="attribr">Methuen &amp; C<sup>o</sup></div>
  </div>

  <p><em>Iron chisels</em> (Pl. III., figs, 1 and 2) are found on almost all
    floors, and were it not for noting the actual spots where they are
    found and the associated articles, it would be difficult to state,
    so closely do they resemble each other, which of them were antique
    and which old or modern native. This difficulty is increased when old
    Kafir iron-chisels and picks are found to be greatly corroded, while
    some of the iron tools found in positions suggesting a great antiquity
    are sometimes found in an almost perfect condition. The sizes of the
    various chisels used by the ancients on blocks in the oldest portions
    of the ruins, and also on the soapstone beams, are still clearly
    distinguishable.</p>

  <p><em>Iron picks</em> are found on older native floors, and these vary in make
    and design, and may be classified as follows:—</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) Double-pointed picks made of a short, thick piece of iron tapered
    at each end, the middle part of which is held by a short iron handle
    (Pl. II., fig. 11). These have also been found in old workings in
    both Matabeleland and Mashonaland, and especially in the Mazoe and
    neighbouring districts. Several of the early writers on this country
    state that these picks had been supplied to their native labourers
    by the mediæval Portuguese, but it is impossible at present to state
    whether this belief be correct or otherwise. Certainly these picks have
    been mostly found in districts once occupied by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> the Portuguese. There
    is a character in the design, class of iron used, and the make that
    does not suggest a native origin.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) An iron pick (Pl. III., fig. 3), similar to the one shown on
    page 217 of Mr. Bent’s book, but in a better state of preservation,
    was recently found at Zimbabwe. It is almost certain that this class
    of pick once had wooden handles up the middle of which was a hole, and
    through it passed the iron bar which bound the pick and the handle
    firmly together.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) The pick (Pl. II., fig. 11) is formed by a bar of iron which is
    bent back a few inches from the top, and in the front of the bend is a
    hole running up the centre inside the bent-back portion, and into this
    hole the haft of the pick is fixed. These have been found complete.</p>

  <p>All three classes of picks are found on intermediate and upper clay
    floors, yet the local natives affirm that they have never known them to
    be made, though they are aware of their purpose.</p>

  <p>Included in the finds of iron articles was a well-made <em>iron spoon</em>
    with a long handle squared at the end. This was found among the Arab
    belongings in Renders Ruins, also an <em>iron spearhead</em> (Pl. II., fig.
    16) with peculiarly designed spaces in its edges as if for inflicting
    a more than usually serious wound. An <em>ornamented spearhead</em> (Pl. II.,
    fig. 15) with its point decorated with bead-like bevels diminishing in
    size from base to point. An <em>iron lamp-stand</em> (PI. II., figs. 17 and
    18) with eight bent-up arms (with which was found 12 ft. of fine copper
    chain in lengths of about 18 in. with pottery affixed at intervals) was
    also found with the Arab articles.</p>

  <p><em>Iron bangles</em>, both solid and of wire-work, are found on upper floors
    in the black surface mould and among grass roots. Some of these must
    be exceedingly old, and in the wire bangles the fibre or zebra hair
    (this, in some instances, being found intact), round which the wire
    was twisted, has completely disappeared. In many instances some traces
    more or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span> less distinct of the fibre or hair still remained. Twisted
    iron wire-work, evidently imported wholesale, has been found at one
    spot only, and in great quantities in the form of coils, and not cut up
    into lengths for use as bangles. The coils, which are now fused, must
    have contained very many feet of this twisted wire. The same applies to
    coils of twisted brass wire in large coils found also at the same spot,
    which, as is shown later, was evidently an old Arab trading station.</p>

  <p><em>Iron nails</em> (Pl. II., figs. 2 and 4) are not limited to any particular
    floor, and are found almost everywhere in the ruins. But these vary
    considerably in make. The oldest form of nail and the best designed
    is that found at greatest depth. This is wedge-shape headed. Another
    form of exceedingly old class of nails is that where the head is formed
    by doubling the nail back for about half an inch. But the head is not
    welded, the bottom part of the bent-back portion being slightly tapered
    where it meets the side of the nail. These nails in several instances
    were made difficult of extraction from the wood by being barbed and
    notched, and in some cases, especially of a rivet class of smaller
    nails, the nails, when the iron was hot, were twisted in the centre
    only, and a rude sort of screw was thus made with protruding edges.
    It can be seen that several twisting operations were required to form
    these spiral bandings, and that these separate twistings do not connect
    together as in a perfect screw. The larger nails are from 4 in. to 6
    in. long, the rivet class varying from 1½ in. to 4 in.</p>

  <p><em>Iron shoes and collars</em> once having served as bands round wooden
    posts, possibly to keep them from splitting, especially in a climate
    where there are daily such rapid changes from heat to cold, and which
    plays such havoc with the modern imported timber. These bands, which
    average almost an inch in width, generally passed twice round the post,
    and the shapes of the circumference of the post are square, oblong
    (these are the most frequent), or circular, but always per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>fectly
    exact, showing that the ancients and older inhabitants of the ruins
    used wood that had been specially shaped with tools, and not the rough,
    unworked poles used by old and present natives, many of which can be
    still seen never to have been touched with any tool save in cutting
    it from the tree and in lopping off small branches. These shoes and
    collars are found on very old floors, their greatest length or diameter
    being 4¾ in.</p>

  <p>One important fact is clearly demonstrated by the presence in
    quantities on the older floors of nails and shoes, and it is that the
    original builders and their more immediate successors extensively
    employed woodwork in the fittings of all the enclosures, some of it
    being of large dimensions, and in all probability worked with tools,
    and not used in the rough state. The general distribution of these
    nails and shoes throughout the enclosures, and at some depth, convinces
    one that substantial wooden fittings once existed in these enclosures,
    for the large sizes of the older forms of nails and the make of the
    shoes and collars preclude any suggestion of many of them having been
    used in woodwork which could have been easily removed.</p>

  <p>A <em>forked iron instrument</em> (Pl. II., fig. 5), with six gold bosses
    riveted with gold on to the iron, is certainly of a very antique
    character, though possibly not an article belonging to the original
    builders, for the condition of the iron and its location, while
    pointing to some antiquity, rather precludes any idea of its being
    of the earliest date. This was found in the Western Temple at the
    Acropolis ruins, at a point near, but not so deep as, the spot which
    Mr. Swan styles “the centre of the arc of the curved and decorated main
    wall of the Western Temple on the hill.”</p>

  <p>The <em>iron pincers</em> (Pl. II., fig. 2), found with the gold scorifiers
    on an intermediate floor in the Elliptical Temple, are of simple
    construction, and are made of a bar of iron tapered at each end and
    doubled together, the doubled end being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span> hammered close, but not
    welded. Traces of flux are on the tapered points. A second pair of iron
    pincers, but not in such good condition, were found on an intermediate
    floor in the Acropolis ruins.</p>

  <p>Some six pairs of <em>double iron gongs</em> were also recently found, but not
    in any position or associated with articles suggesting antiquity. These
    were found on old Makalanga floors, also among grass roots and in black
    surface mould. Yet the type and pattern of gong is undoubtedly ancient,
    being found in Egypt and seen in the ancient paintings in that country,
    but like the rod of iron, the pillow, the ingot mould, and a score of
    other articles used not only by Makalanga but by other peoples of this
    continent, the form and make of these gongs have been handed down from
    time immemorial. The local natives know the use of these gongs, and
    say that they were beaten with an iron striker (Pl. II., fig. 20), but
    they have not seen any at Zimbabwe since they arrived seventy years
    ago, nor can they say that their own people ever made them, but they
    suppose that the old Makalanga, who, up to at least one hundred years
    ago, are known to have lived in the Zimbabwe ruins, made and used them.
    These gongs are known to local natives who have travelled, and these
    say they have seen them in use in the Zambesia districts, where they
    are used to greet the arrival of chiefs and the appearance of the new
    moon, also as a signal of warning. The two gongs are bound together
    by an iron band, which forms the handle. One pair was found on the
    floor of a hut built on block foundations with the usual clay-rounded,
    bevelled, and circular base, exactly similar to those on the filled-in
    plateau of No. 1 Ruins at Khami (see Chapter VII., section “Native
    Huts found in Ancient Ruins,” <i>post</i>, p. 152). The gongs found at
    Zimbabwe average 16½ in. high, and their sides are hammered together
    out of two thick sheets of soft iron. They have no clappers, and are
    intended to be struck from without. They have frequently been found
    in Kazembe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span> country between the Zambesi and Lake Tanganyika, where
    the natives state that the gongs are not made now, and that they are
    very old (<cite>Anthrop. Journal</cite>, 1901, Article 39). Dr. Holub (vol. ii.,
    p. 147) gives an illustration of a double iron gong of crude make and
    design, still in use among the Barotse as a musical instrument. Sir
    H. M. Stanley states that these double iron gongs were in use by the
    natives of Urangi (Upper Congo), and also at Mangala on that river.
    His illustrations of these gongs show great similarity to those found
    in various parts of Southern Rhodesia. Several writers on South-East
    Africa describe an identical iron gong still in use among the natives.
    Each gong gives a different sound to its companion gong.</p>

  <p>A <em>single iron gong</em> (Pl. II., fig. 22) was also found among old native
    articles. The gong is oblong, and has an ornament at each end made
    of tapered strips of iron coiled into circles, and these ornaments
    strongly suggest that the gong was only used when suspended. It is 13½
    in. long and 5½ in. deep. No explorer in this country appears to have
    seen a gong of this description. Its style and make are altogether
    unique.</p>

  <p>One iron rod or sceptre, 3 ft. 5 in. long, was also found in a position
    not suggestive of antiquity. This was recognised by the natives as
    the rod of a chief, being a native symbol of power. Some of the
    dynastic chiefs of the Makalanga still possess these iron rods. The
    end of the rod is bent back to form the handle. Mr. Bent says the iron
    sceptres borne by Makalanga chiefs have their parallels in the north
    of the African continent! Ruling “with a rod of iron” is a scriptural
    description of despotic government.</p>

  <p>Pieces of worked iron, with rings let through the top ends and
    broadening at the base, where there is a different shaped hole of a
    distinct form on each base, appear to have been <em>keys</em> (Pl. II., figs.
    7 and 8). These were found with the Arab belongings in Renders Ruins.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

  <p>There are still to be seen the remains of native <em>iron-smelting
    furnaces</em>, one being in almost perfect condition, but all are
    exceedingly old, and were found standing seventy years ago, when the
    present Makalanga came to live at Zimbabwe. The “female breast and
    furrow” pattern is on every native furnace. Portions of <em>blow-pipes</em>
    and great quantities of <em>iron slag</em> are found on the higher floors of
    clay in several of the ruins.</p>

  <h3>5. BRASS ARTICLES</h3>

  <p>So far as investigations lead, no relics of brass have been found on
    the lower floors of any of the ruins at Zimbabwe. But on the upper
    clay floors brass in several forms is found in abundance. It will be
    remembered that in 1514 Duarte Barbosa wrote, “The people of Monomotapa
    come to Sofala charged with gold, and give such quantities that the
    merchants gain one hundred for one.” This was written soon after the
    first arrival of the Portuguese at Sofala, and given in a description
    of Arab trade on the coast, which they found to be flourishing. But
    before that period the Arab barter article for the gold was mainly
    brass, though “coloured stuffs and beads of Cambay” were also used for
    the purpose of barter, for the Arab trade with this country dated back
    long before the arrival of the Portuguese. The Arab writer, Omar ibn
    l’Wardi, stated (<i>circa</i> 1200 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), in alluding to South-East
    Africa, “The most remarkable produce of this country is its quantity of
    native gold ... in spite of which the natives adorn their persons with
    ornaments of brass.” So to-day a native will gladly pay an enormous
    amount over the cost price for any attractive-looking but shoddy brass
    article. The brass ornaments of women weigh from 1½ lbs. to 3 lbs.,
    while the men spend hours in polishing and rearranging their brass
    bangles. Therefore it is not surprising that brass wire, brass wire
    bangles, and solid brass bangles, should be found on the clay floors of
    the ruins.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span> The quantity imported as barter goods for gold must have
    been simply enormous, especially in view of the prevailing custom of
    these people from time immemorial to bury with their dead all their
    personal ornaments.</p>

  <p>There is one class of brass bangle that deserves some attention, and
    this is found in positions suggesting a greater age than any other
    finds of brass articles. This is a twisted wire bangle, but the wire
    is flat and exceedingly narrow. In many of these the hair or fibre
    round which it was coiled has disappeared with time. Coils of this
    make of wire-work ready to be cut into lengths for bangles were found
    in Renders Ruins. This and some coils of very fine rounded wire-work
    were discovered in a fused condition. Brass beads both imported and of
    native make are plentiful.</p>

  <h3>6. FOREIGN STONES</h3>

  <p>Every enclosure in the ruins at Zimbabwe which has been recently
    examined yields stone altogether foreign to the granite formation
    of the district. Many tons of <em>slate</em> have been brought here from
    a distance of at least eight miles, and also large quantities of
    soapstone from a similar distance, while <em>dolorite</em>, once used as
    anvils, was discovered, also <em>diorite</em> used as hammers, <em>quartz</em>,
    <em>jasper</em> stone showing gold, <em>serpentine</em> stone, <em>calcedony</em> pebbles,
    <em>crystal</em> pebbles, <em>metamorphic slate</em>, <em>mica schist</em>, <em>ironstone</em>
    and <em>copper ore</em>, and one or two small fragments of <em>flint</em>, and some
    <em>natural wind-worn stones</em> of peculiar form. A lithologist could
    very easily add considerably to this list. Two pieces of water-worn
    diorite of the shape of rolling-pins were found in the débris below
    the Platform at the Western Temple on the Acropolis. The finding of
    one such stone might not in itself be considered of any moment, but
    the discovery of two such pieces similar in shape may possibly have
    some significance for the student of the litholatrous practices of
    the ancients. The same might be said of several stones discovered
    here, many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span> of which in quantities naturally assume suggestive shapes,
    while some are of purely imitative forms and not artificially treated.
    Several of the quartz pebbles showed gold very richly. All these, with
    the exception of the quartz, ironstone and copper ore, were found on
    the lowest floors.</p>

  <p>There were also found water-worn stones, mostly slates, with artificial
    depressions which had undoubtedly been used as tools, in some instances
    as burnishing stones, these latter being found associated with the
    older form of gold crucibles, and some of these had been most probably
    selected on account of their shape admirably suiting the fingers of the
    right hand. Some small slabs of slate found at considerable depths show
    evidences of having been extensively used as whetstones for sharpening
    edge tools.</p>

  <p>About one ton and a half of metamorphic slate, called by Mr. Bent
    “black slate,” and similar to that used in the mural decorations on the
    north face of the wall of No. 11 Enclosure and on the north-east wall
    of the Platform, was found among the débris in the Sacred Enclosure and
    in Nos. 9, 11, and 12 enclosures of the Elliptical Temple, especially
    at the base of the wall containing the pattern formed by means of
    these stones. All loose blocks are now stacked together in the Sacred
    Enclosure (west) at the angle formed by the Platform and the wall
    dividing off No. 9 Enclosure. At least some four tons of these blocks
    had been brought to Zimbabwe, the nearest point being on the Motelekwe
    River, at eight miles east-north-east of Zimbabwe. It is somewhat
    remarkable that no such blocks were found in the western half of the
    Elliptical Temple, nor on the Acropolis, nor at any other ruin in the
    locality.</p>

  <p>Beds of small splinters of imported quartz have been found at several
    points within the ruin’s area, the largest being on the west side of
    No. 1 Ruins and on the north side of the summit of Rusivanga Kopje.
    Splinters of quartz are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span> found on all cement floors and on such floors
    as are made of burnt clay. Some of the quartz showed traces of gold,
    but most of the pannings were blank. It has never been supposed that
    the original builders carried on extensive quartz-crushing operations
    at Zimbabwe, but that the gold was brought to Zimbabwe in the form of
    dust to be smelted into ingots, both for export and local manufacture.
    Possibly the quartz was brought here for testing purposes, for these
    people who were so well acquainted with the nature of quartz-mining
    must have had some centres throughout the country where quartz could be
    tested, and it is quite natural that the “assay office” of the ancients
    for the surrounding districts might have been at Zimbabwe.</p>

  <h3>7. BEADS</h3>

  <p>In addition to beads of gold, copper, and brass, several other
    descriptions of these articles have recently been found at Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p>The most important are two large beads similar to one found by Mr.
    Bent, and to which he attributed a great antiquity, also some broken
    pieces of similar beads. These are black, and are covered with flowers
    resembling primroses, and the flower is outlined by parallel white
    lines. The spaces between these lines are filled in with dark brown and
    violet glaze. These were all found at great depth. The local natives
    had not seen beads of this make before.</p>

  <p>Beads of ivory and bone, also opaque glass beads—green and yellow,
    porcelain beads of sea-green colour and ribbed, have been found, the
    glass and porcelain beads being quite unknown to the present natives. A
    diamond-shaped calcedony bead,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> some clay beads bearing chevron and
    herring-bone patterns, were found on the lower clay floors.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

  <h3>8. WHORLS</h3>

  <p>Pottery whorls of about 1½ in. to 3 in. in diameter have been found in
    hundreds. These were used by old natives for drawing the threads out
    of a mass of cotton. A stick was passed through the centre, and the
    bottom end was inserted in the cotton, while the upper part was twisted
    round quickly between the palms of the hand. Most whorls are cut out of
    fragments of native bowls and pots. Many old natives will explain how
    they were used. These clay whorls are found in old deserted villages
    and in Makalanga débris heaps. The native children search for them, and
    use them as tops. It is said they were once also employed in creating
    sparks for a fire, but to-day the natives twirl the sticks between
    their palms without using a whorl. A few soapstone whorls have been
    found, but not in any position suggesting antiquity. The Makalanga of
    but a generation past were adepts in carving soapstone.</p>

  <h3>9. GLASS POTTERY AND CHINA</h3>

  <p>These finds are so numerous and diversified that they require a
    special work for their proper treatment. Some two hundred specimens
    selected from the bulk have been collected, and these with particulars
    as to their locations and associated articles, with specimens found
    elsewhere in Rhodesia, will be laid before an expert for technical
    classification, when another avenue of research with regard to the
    ancient and mediæval occupiers of this country, both native and
    foreign, will certainly be opened up. Meantime a brief reference to the
    finds, or some of them, will here suffice.</p>

  <p>Two portions of glass prisms, fragments of Venetian glass of dark
    green colour, being as thin and sometimes thinner than an ordinary
    watch-glass, have quite recently been found.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span> Sections of two bowls of
    Arabian glass<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> covered with very fine and delicately engraved tracery
    of scroll-work of flowers and tendrils. The engraving is so minute that
    it can only be seen in a strong light.</p>

  <p>Over and across the engraved designs are hand-painted flowers of
    primrose shape, each flower outlined in white, light blue, and pink,
    the buds being pink and white, and the stems a dark red. The shape
    of the bowls was that of the modern finger-glass. All these were
    discovered at considerable depths.</p>

    <div class="caption">Arabian Glass</div>
  </div>

  <p>Most of the pottery was found in hundred-weights in débris heaps and
    scattered throughout all the clay floors in all the ruins with the
    exception of some enclosures in the Valley of Ruins. But such pottery
    can be shown to be of native make. To anyone casually inspecting the
    pottery it may appear as of one and the same make, save perhaps in the
    colour of the clay of which it is made. But there are wide differences
    in the pottery, both in the clays, the make, designs, ornamentation,
    colourings, and also in their locations <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129</span>
    and in their manufacturers, just as among the present natives.</p>

  <p>The Barotse pottery, for instance, is of a more substantial make than
    is that of any known period or tribe of Makalanga. The patterns are
    large, bold, and entirely geometrical, and are coloured yellow, red,
    or black, with the designs painted in strong contrast to the general
    colour of the pot. Thus black patterns are laid on yellow and red
    grounds, red patterns on yellow and black, and yellow patterns on black
    and red. A collection of Barotse pottery made by Major Corydon from
    north of the Zambesi is a facsimile in make and design of the Barotse
    pottery found at Thabas Imamba, Khami, Zimbabwe, and other ruins known
    to have been occupied by Barotse up to seventy years ago. A collection
    of pottery from Khami which was brought for comparative examination to
    Zimbabwe was at once claimed by the local Barotse as being of Barotse
    make, while the local Makalanga not only emphatically denied that it
    was of their class of make and design, but added that it was the work
    of the Barotse people. The encircling bands of ornamentation on Barotse
    pottery vary from 1½ in. to 3 in. or more in depth.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

  <p>Thus Makalanga pottery has its own peculiar characteristics which are
    easily discernible on examination. It is generally found to be black
    with a highly polished surface. The bowls and pots have a lighter and
    more delicate appearance, and the excellent quality of clay used, and
    its thorough manipulation, enables it to be much thinner in make yet
    equally as strong as those of coarser make; the coloured decoration
    also is altogether absent, while the pattern is more neatly executed,
    and is enclosed in encircling bands of from only half an inch to one
    inch in depth. Further, the Makalanga have always decorated their
    pottery with protruding bosses of shapes and designs peculiar to
    themselves, the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>female breast pattern predominating. There are at
    least fifty different sorts of such protruding designs already found
    on undoubted Makalanga floors, and these have been selected for
    examination. The pot shown in the illustration facing page 90 of <cite>The
    Ancient Ruins of Rhodesia</cite> is of very old Makalanga work, of which many
    scores are found represented at Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p>Finds of native pottery bear no traces of the potter’s wheel. All
    native pottery is made by hand.</p>

  <p>Very common sun-burnt earthenware, more earth than clay, and very
    light, is found in great quantities everywhere in the ruins, most of
    this having no decoration.</p>

  <p>Old Makalanga smeared the body of a pot with several thin coats of
    different-coloured clays, and sections of such pottery show the lines
    of smearings very distinctly.</p>

  <p>The best quality of pottery was found on one of the lowest floors in
    the Elliptical Temple. The fragments are very heavy for their size,
    and the surface is coated with soapstone clay, giving them a light
    greenish-grey colour. These must be exceedingly old if not ancient.</p>

  <p>The china discovered includes Nankin china identical in every
    particular with the Nankin china discovered at these ruins by Mr. Bent
    and others, and with that found in Mazoe and so many other districts
    where there still exist distinct evidences of occupation by the early
    Portuguese. The china, or porcelain, is covered completely with a
    highly rich glaze of bright blue and sea-green shades, and the articles
    when pieced together resemble in shape, an ordinary soup-plate. The
    edges are bevelled in sections of circles, the bevels extending in
    fluted form to the base, where can be seen evidences of the use of the
    potter’s wheel. The fragments found represent three different plates.
    These were discovered at some depth, but not on any ancient floor.</p>

  <p>One find made among the Arab belongings in Renders Ruins consists of
    excellent china of a light brown colour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span> about a quarter of an inch
    thick, and covered with a high glaze of blue, white, and gold enamel,
    the white forming the background. There are at least four bands of
    pattern encircling what was a large open bowl with upright edges. The
    conjectured Arab lettering is laid on with blue enamel and is outlined
    with fine scroll-work tracery in gold. The inside is glazed white, and
    has lines of faint blue enamel artistically drawn without being of any
    set pattern. The pattern on the lowest band is of palm fronds in brown
    paint and in outline only.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_131">
    <img src="images/i_131.jpg" width="600" height="551" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Some very thin pottery covered with white enamel some inches only
    down from the rim towards the outer and inner <span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>base, with thick
    perpendicular bars of dull blue glaze. Excellent pottery of brown clay,
    very thickly covered with glaze of sea-green and deep lake colours, was
    found near the same spot.</p>

  <h3>10. A MEDIÆVAL ARAB TRADING STATION</h3>

  <p>One of the most interesting discoveries recently made was at Renders
    Ruins in the Valley of Ruins. In a corner of one of the enclosures of
    these ruins, and at some depth, and all within a few feet, were found
    the glazed pottery with Arab lettering, an iron lamp-stand and copper
    chain, an iron spoon of great age, copper snake-rings (pronounced not
    to be of native make), and several other articles suggesting some
    far back period of an Arab occupation, most probably of mediæval times.
    Over this collection of finds was a deep bed of soil silted by rains
    from higher ground, and on this surface were fragments of a Makalanga
    clay floor broken up by the roots. The Arab traders gave the first
    description of these ruins to the Portuguese, and Barbosa (1514), De
    Barros (1552), and Livio Sanuto (1588), mention the existence of Great
    Zimbabwe on the strength of information concerning it received from the
    Arab gold and ivory traders.</p>

  <p>In all probability this was an Arab trading centre of mediæval times,
    and by “taking stock” of the barter goods, some corroboration of this
    suggestion may be obtained. The “stock in trade” consisted of:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="hang">2 pints of small yellow and green glass
      beads which are unknown to present natives.</p>

    <p class="hang">1 pint of similar beads of larger size, also unknown to present
      natives.</p>

    <p class="hang">100 (at least) porcelain beads, ribbed, and of sea-green
      colour, also unknown to natives.</p>

    <p class="hang">15 lbs. of twisted iron wire-work in large coils for making
      bangles, and cut up into lengths for bangles.</p>

    <p class="hang">5 lbs. of twisted brass flat wire in large coils also, not cut
      into lengths for bangles.</p>

    <p class="hang"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

    <p class="hang">5 lbs. of twisted brass rounded wire, ditto.</p>

    <p class="hang">4 doz. brass flat wire bangles and a great quantity of
      fragments of other bangles.</p>

    <p class="hang">Cowrie shells.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The mediæval traders might have received the following from the natives:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      2 elephant tusks (decayed).<br />
      2 wart-hog tusks.<br />
      20 (about) pieces of beaten gold.<br />
      Several pieces of broken gold-wire bangles.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As the Arabs traded for gold produced by the natives, and also for
    ivory, no doubt they or the natives would fossick in the ruins, then
    much clearer of débris, for gold which they or the Arabs might have
    known was to be found in the enclosures. The beaten gold was all found
    within a few inches, and though its edges were pierced with tack-holes,
    pannings of the soil showed no gold tacks. As the Makalanga of those
    times were at their zenith of power, it is quite possible they did the
    actual searching themselves, and then parted with their finds to the
    Arabs, who, as history shows, only occupied the land on sufferance, the
    Arabs making their usual gain, which, according to Barbosa, was “one
    hundred for one.”</p>

  <p>It might well be asked why these old Arabs left their goods behind
    them. The fickle policy of successive Monomotapas might be a sufficient
    explanation of their apparently hasty exodus. According to Portuguese
    records Kapranzine, the Monomotapa in 1620, sided with the Portuguese
    as against the local Arabs, and the succeeding Monomotapa “Pedro” in
    1643 maintained this policy. But the disappearance of the Arab traders
    from Renders Ruins will in all probability always remain an unsolved
    enigma. But one question may be asked with regard to the beads found
    here—Were they “beads of Cambay”?</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

  <p>A large piece of coral still in perfect condition was found with the
    Arab articles. It has been stated, with what truth the author cannot
    say, that finely ground coral powder makes an excellent metal polish,
    and that the Arabs and Indian metal-workers on the coast use it for
    this purpose. Certainly the Arab traders up country would constantly
    require to refurbish their brass goods, and so keep them attractive for
    sale to the natives. Fragments of coral have been found in other ruins
    at Zimbabwe, also at ruins in different parts of Southern Rhodesia very
    much further inland from the coast than is Zimbabwe.</p>

    Walls within the ruins—Remains of Native Huts found in
    Ruins—Passages—Entrances and Buttresses.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">SINCE 1892, when the late Theodore Bent published his work on <cite>The
    Ruined Cities of Mashonaland</cite>, and 1893, when Sir John Willoughby
    issued his monograph on <cite>Further Explorations at Zimbabwe</cite>, though
    much has been discovered concerning the varying architectural types of
    ancient ruins throughout Southern Rhodesia, little has been added to
    our previous meagre store of information concerning the important group
    of ruins at Great Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p>But in the work now in progress of preserving these ruins from
    preventable decay and dilapidation, and of clearing away the block
    débris from the faces of the walls and the huge piles of soil débris
    deposited within the ruins by a long succession of explorers, both
    authorised and unauthorised, there have been within the last two years
    rescued from oblivion many important architectural features, the
    existence of which was altogether unsuspected by previous writers. Many
    of the interiors of the ruins are now exposed to view, thus enabling
    examinations, comparison, and measurements to be taken which before had
    been altogether impossible. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>Within the last eighteen months Zimbabwe
    has revealed many of the long-buried secrets of the ancient architects
    which were hidden from the eyes of Bent, Schlichter, and other
    scientific explorers of the ruins.</p>

  <p>Zimbabwe is stored with surprises for archæologists and antiquarians.
    Absorbing romance is buried deep below its floors. Its soil is richly
    charged with long-ungazed-at gold and prehistoric relics of high
    intrinsic value. The mysteries of the absence in Zimbabwe of any
    definite records in the form of inscriptions,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and also of the
    non-discovery within the Zimbabwe area of the burial-places of the
    ancients, have yet to be solved.</p>

  <p>It has quite recently been held by scientists at home that the late
    discoveries of ancient ruins in Rhodesia, with their classifications
    into types and probable time-sequences and periods of distinct forms
    of architecture, have so advanced investigations in this country
    that, until similar work has been carried on among such of the ruins
    of Southern Arabia as are believed to synchronise with, or be the
    architectural prototypes of, the earliest of the Rhodesian monuments,
    it would be idle to speak dogmatically as to the lands of origin of
    the succession of ancient builders and gold miners who toiled so
    industriously in this portion of South-East Africa.</p>

  <p>Still, but so far only as authentic discoveries have been made, the
    suggested occupation by the Sabæo-Arabians as outlined in chapter iii.
    of <cite>The Ancient Ruins of Rhodesia</cite> affords for the present a good
    working hypothesis for the student in Rhodesia whose aim should be to
    closely watch the operations of archæologists and antiquarians in the
    land of ancient Yemen, while at the same time recording with the utmost
    exactness and fullest detail all and every possible architectural
    feature of such of the ruins in Rhodesia as may fall within the
    description of the First Period of Zimbabwe</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

  <p>Architecture, of which the Great Zimbabwe is undoubtedly a most
    perfect example. This work will awaken the most piquant interest and
    fascination, for in this direction may be found the definite solution
    of our local problem as to which particular wave of the Semitic
    migrations is responsible for the erection of certain of our ruins.</p>

  <p>That the Great Zimbabwe will be found to be pregnant with clues to
    solve the mystery is undoubted. Notwithstanding two years’ work in
    clearing the ruins of fallen walls and silted-in soil, nine-tenths of
    the ruins still remain practically buried. Sir John Willoughby, after
    spending two months in exploring the Elliptical Temple with a large
    staff of labourers, writes that it would take at least two years to
    complete the exploration of that building, and this without touching
    anything ancient or piercing ancient floors, but simply leaving the
    building clear of all débris and just in the same condition, save for
    dilapidations, as the last race of ancient occupiers knew it. If,
    therefore, the Elliptical Temple would require this amount of time
    to be spent upon it—and this is a fair estimate of work yet to be
    done—then the Acropolis ruins must require at least a further three
    years to be spent upon them, and this calculation does not include
    the large number of ruins in the Valley of Ruins, which, if situated
    elsewhere in the country, would be considered of major importance.
    But the area of the Zimbabwe ruins, as known to Sir John Willoughby,
    was only 945 yds. by 940 yds. To-day, after carefully searching the
    surrounding kopjes, kloofs, and valleys, other ruins and walls, and
    traces of ancient walls, can be found at a distance of a mile from the
    Elliptical Temple. The Bentberg has its northern face covered with
    walls. Rusivanga Kopje shows foundations of walls and débris. Near
    Bingura’s kraal, a mile to the south-west, is a ruin, while extensive
    beds of imported gold quartz—the nearest reef being some miles
    distant—with piles of ancient blocks are to be discovered after a grass
    fire in almost all directions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span> within the distance of a mile, and fresh
    traces of old peoples, other than those early Makalanga, are to be met
    with in the course of almost every walk. Thus the probabilities of new
    and important discoveries are incalculably great.</p>

  <h3>DEGREE OF DURABILITY OF WALLS</h3>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) As may be seen by anyone
    inspecting the walls, as well as on perusing the published description
    of many ruins of the earliest types, the elliptical and curved form
    of building has proved the most durable. In many instances the
    elliptical structures are more or less intact, while the angular and
    less skilfully built additions, extensions, and alterations of a later
    period have largely become ruinous and chaotic.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) This is accounted for by the more excellent workmanship in the
    construction of the ruins of the elliptical type, which have far
    broader foundations, are more massive, have a decided batter-back both
    inside and outside, bonded courses, the blocks of each course being
    more carefully selected, and the summits tied with “throughs,” while
    the angular type of ruins, with their plumb walls built on straight
    lines, with independent faces either side and carelessly filled-in
    interiors, and a less superior workmanship, have caused these walls to
    suffer more than the older type of ruins.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) Walls built on curved lines are in a far better state of
    preservation than those built on straight lines, the curves having
    served to strengthen the walls.</p>

  <p>(<i>d</i>) Rounded ends of walls and rounded buttresses have proved to be
    far more durable than angular ends or squared buttresses, though most
    of these latter erections are obviously of a later date.</p>

  <p>(<i>e</i>) The portions of divisional walls near main walls are in a better
    state of preservation than the other portions which are in the open
    parts of the ruins. This is owing to the protection and support of the
    larger walls. Many of the divisional walls are practically independent,
    and therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span> more liable to collapse, but if not independent the
    number of entrances passing through them practically makes them such.</p>

  <h3>DILAPIDATIONS</h3>

  <p>At Zimbabwe both the ravages of time, as well as
    preventable damage during the last decade, have brought about the
    wholesale destruction of walls as seen to-day in their dilapidated
    condition. This is the plaint of all who have known the ruins since
    the time of the occupation. These all bemoan the fact that on each
    renewed visit to the ruins some wall is found to have disappeared, or
    some new bulging out of the massive structures threatens serious and
    immediate destruction, which no amount of lateral support or pinning
    up can now possibly prevent. Many such visitors complain that the
    decorative patterns are becoming less perfect. Photographs show this to
    be the case. In fact, so much dilapidation has taken place within the
    last few years that it is a common remark of pioneers that “the ruins
    are becoming less and less every year,” while intense disappointment
    and vexation are expressed by “old hands” when they revisit the temple
    after an interval of a few years at the serious reduction in the height
    of the Conical Tower. Photographs of the tower taken as recently as
    1896 represent the summit as being higher than is seen to-day, while
    almost every photograph taken within the last two or three years of any
    single part of these ruins shows portions, if not the whole, of walls,
    with their distinctive features that have completely disappeared. To
    those who venerate these ancient edifices nothing can be sadder than a
    comparison of the ruins as seen to-day with the ruins as they were some
    years ago.</p>

  <p>But before dealing with the dilapidations of later years it might be
    well to examine the history of such of the dilapidations as can be
    read in the wall débris heaps which line the bases of every wall, for
    these débris heaps can be read with the same facility as one can read a
    book. These dilapidations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span> are what might be termed legitimate, being
    the natural results of the ravages of time, which no means taken could
    possibly have avoided, and which have extended for very many centuries
    on end since the latest of the ancient occupiers disappeared.</p>

  <p>In Tintern, Melrose, and many another old building at Home we have
    ruins even now incomplete, owing to the dilapidations of but a few
    hundred years. But the most ancient ruins of Great Britain, excepting,
    of course, Stonehenge, the round towers of Ireland, the Druidical
    circles of Wales, the stone circles and cloven stones of the Isle of
    Man, and the reputed pagan temples found elsewhere, and certain of the
    Roman remains of which at present little is known, possess histories,
    and <cite>Domesday Book</cite>, and even much later records, state the names of
    the actual builders of these castles and abbeys. These buildings have
    a stamp upon them of modernity which is altogether absent at Zimbabwe,
    in comparison with the age of which the term “ancient,” as applied
    to those at Home, elastic as it is, sounds strangely inappropriate.
    And yet after a comparatively short period of non-occupation of these
    castles and buildings only sections of them can now be seen. Guides
    will state that the walls have been quarried for material for farm
    buildings, most probably for the erection of the adjoining mansion, and
    that portions were destroyed by lightning.</p>

  <p>But Zimbabwe, with its minimum age of some three millenniums,
    stands far more firm, more intact, and complete than any one of the
    comparatively few-centuried old ruins to be found anywhere at Home.
    Planted in South-East Africa at over two hundred miles inland from the
    coast, in the midst of populations that know nothing whatever of its
    origin, Zimbabwe’s massive and imposing walls reveal even to the most
    casual and indifferent of visitors the plan, purpose, and design of the
    original builders. Yet has it been subjected for three millenniums to
    the destructive agency of lightning storms, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span> frequency and severity
    of which in South-East Africa are well known. Severe earthquakes must
    have shaken its foundations, but the massive walls remain practically
    intact. Arab tradition speaks of violent earthquakes in South-East
    Africa during the fifth century, while the condition of some of the
    ruins in Rhodesia, where the walls have fallen <i>en bloc</i> sideways on to
    the ground, testifies to frequent, general, and violent earth-movements
    and earth-strains having taken place. The South-East African cyclones
    passing over it during thirty centuries probably have caused further
    dilapidations. Still, though so many walls at Zimbabwe remain more
    or less intact, it would be impossible to estimate the extent to
    which many walls may have suffered, or what have possibly disappeared
    altogether from the effects of earthquakes, for it would be difficult
    to suppose that these extensive ruins—some walls being built on the
    actual brink of precipices—have escaped all the destructive effects of
    earth-movements and storms which have occurred during the last three
    thousand years.</p>

  <p>The action of sub-tropical rains for centuries has destroyed whole
    lengths of walls. For instance, a trench which occupied half a dozen
    labourers two days to excavate was, after a heavy shower lasting but an
    hour, completely filled up by mud streams from a higher level. There
    is hardly a wall on the Acropolis Hill that has not had to bear some
    added weight of silted soil from higher levels, and these in places
    have been so extensive that when accumulated on the upper sides of
    walls the effect has been to push the wall bodily over. In this way the
    terraces of enclosures round the north, west, and south faces of the
    Acropolis have in most instances been entirely filled up and buried,
    while in others the outer and down-side wall has been burst through
    and destroyed. Streams of water during storms of real African violence
    have worn deep channels along the bases of some of the walls, exposing
    the foundations which bridge across the holes, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span> water causing the
    decomposition of the cement bed of the foundations and making the
    wall throughout its complete height to sway downwards and to bulge
    threateningly outwards. Some of these water-made holes up against the
    bases of the walls contained damp and moisture all through the dry
    season, especially those on the south side of walls where the holes
    were protected from the sun. In as many cases as possible for the time
    engaged on the preservation work (1902–4) these spots were levelled,
    and catchment areas were made, so that for the future no rain-water can
    lodge there, but the waving lines of the courses in the walls still
    show where these holes existed.</p>

  <p>In a similar way block débris falling from higher levels has lodged
    behind lower walls and eventually pressed them over. In some instances
    on the Acropolis a mass of walling has fallen from a great height and
    completely demolished walls below. These were no gradual dilapidations,
    but instances where sections of the higher wall had gone completely
    over <i>en masse</i>. Such falls almost entirely explain the damage done
    to the outer walls of the South-East Ancient Ascent, lengths of which
    have evidently been made good by Kafirs of a very old period, as the
    well-built ancient foundations can be seen below the later walls.</p>

  <p>But some walls have also been seriously damaged by falls of huge slabs
    and boulders from the faces of the granite cliffs, buttresses have been
    broken, entrances and passages completely blocked up if not utterly
    demolished. These falls, though later than the times of the ancients,
    occurred very long ago, for the depressions in the cliffs from which
    these slabs and boulders fell are now become weather-stained, but the
    shapes of the depressions and of the slabs and boulders still agree. It
    is conjectured that the gap in the central portion of the main wall of
    the Eastern Temple was caused by the fall of an immense boulder from
    the summit of the sixty-foot cliff on the north side of the temple.
    By<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span> the moving forward of a boulder for six feet from the position it
    occupied at the time of the ancients—and they had utilised this boulder
    in forming the west entrance of the same temple—the entrance was
    completely blocked up.</p>

  <p>But there is a process of dilapidation going on continually, a
    process which, judging by the débris piles, has been operating for
    many centuries. When walking near a wall one has to be very careful
    not to walk under any of the overhanging blocks on the summit of the
    wall. Some of these blocks are very delicately poised on the edges of
    the walls, so much so that it seems as if a shout would cause them
    to fall. Wherever possible these blocks have been drawn back flush
    again with the face of the wall, but in very many cases the walls
    are so ruined that it would be dangerous work to do this. It is one
    of the unfortunate effects of this ancient dry masonry that when one
    block topples over a small cascade of blocks usually follows it. Such
    falls, followed by cascades of blocks, are continually taking place.
    One hears them night and day, especially after rains, and frequently
    these cascades, especially those from walls above the precipice
    on the Acropolis, will continue uninterruptedly for some minutes
    together. There are many points in walls so threatening to collapse
    that no builder’s art of shoring-up could possibly prevent their fall,
    for sooner or later they must come down with a crash. Natives give
    the information that from the time of their childhood they always
    remembered these falls taking place when no one was near the walls.
    Probably the noise of falling blocks, especially at night, has served
    to inspire the local natives with some of the dread in which after
    sundown they regard the ruins. After a heavy shower one can always find
    some damage done to the walls. This is mainly due to the quantity of
    silted soil behind walls, which, becoming overgutted with water, forces
    the walls over. The only remedy, and that a partial one, would appear
    to be to remove the silted soil from behind the walls, but to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span> complete
    such operations a large gang of labourers would have to be engaged for
    many months. Still the complaint of the early pioneer that the walls
    at Zimbabwe are gradually becoming not only less but fewer remains
    perfectly incontrovertible.</p>

  <p>But there is an infinitude of other causes working for the dilapidation
    of the ancient walls at Zimbabwe, and some of these are undoubtedly
    preventable. It was for the purpose of removing such causes of damage
    that the recent work of preservation was undertaken on behalf of the
    Rhodesian Government, and these operations it is the purpose of this
    volume to describe.</p>

  <p>The Great Zimbabwe, as also the many associated ruins scattered
    throughout Southern Rhodesia, has been subject to wholesale destruction
    of its walls by the growth of trees, the presence of damp, the falling
    of immense trees across walls, the quarrying of its walls by past and
    present natives for building material, for cattle kraals, and other
    purposes. All the ruins at Zimbabwe afford ample evidences of the
    ravages caused by vegetable growth, and no ruin appears to have escaped
    some measure of destruction from this cause.</p>

  <p>In 1902 the Elliptical Temple was found to be full of large trees of
    immense girth, some being at least sixty feet in height. The shelter
    from the chilly winds prevailing at night and in the dry winter
    season, and the protection from damage to bark by grass fires provided
    by the high and massive walls, together with the perpetual state
    of damp from wet season to wet season prevailing within the walls,
    the close, hothouse temperature most favourable to the promotion of
    growth, provided an area in which trees and plants could flourish most
    luxuriantly.</p>

  <p>The trees within the temple are almost all hard woods of slow growth.
    One tree, not by any means a large one, showed by its rings an age of
    over a hundred years. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span> numerous fig-trees must be of great age.
    The three immense hard-wood trees in the centre of the building may
    possibly be a hundred years old. The rest of the temple was as full of
    soft-wooded trees as space permitted, while the branches of trees near
    the main walls crowded over the tops of the walls towards the outside.
    Undergrowth of monkey-ropes, wild vines, thorn creepers, and large
    bushes formed a dense jungle through which it was almost impossible to
    pass, while the damp maintained the soil in a wet, soggy state, the
    trees being covered with orchids and long, trailing festoons of lichen,
    the shaded walls being one mass of creepers, green moss, lichens, and
    ferns, and dripping with damp. Certainly such growth made the temple
    beautifully picturesque, and added greatly to its weird, desolate, and
    solemn appearance.</p>

  <p>But a succession of “dust-devils” or “wind twisters” that very
    frequently pass over the country in the breathless sultry hours of
    noon passed over Zimbabwe on the second day after our arrival, and at
    once demonstrated what damage the trees were inflicting on the ruins.
    Branches were set crunching and thumping on the summits of all the
    walls, soft-wood trees bent and swept the walls of loose blocks, two
    huge hard-wood branches remorselessly scraped noisily up and down the
    sides and on the top of the Conical Tower, while small trees growing
    on the actual summits of the walls shook and bent and still further
    loosened the blocks among which their roots extended. During the few
    minutes these “twisters” lasted the labourers studiously avoided the
    walls from which the ancient blocks were falling. Under every branch
    that crossed over a wall was a deep depression in the summit caused
    by the branch thudding upon it. Many of the trees growing close to
    the walls had, with long years of banging against the side of the
    wall, lost all their bark on their inner sides, and these had become
    perfectly flat. All this havoc, caused by rocking trees and sweeping
    branches, and by huge broken limbs falling upon interior walls, must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
    have been going on for many years. The effect has been to cause the
    removal of the “throughs,” ties, and large bonding stones with which
    the ancients secured the summits of the walls, and these once gone
    the wall was subject to rapid dilapidation. Later, during high winds
    which prevailed for some days, it was most distressing to hear the
    noise of the trees grating and heavily beating against the walls,
    and the constant falling down of ancient blocks. The effects of such
    destruction can be seen to-day in the broken edges of the summits
    and in the deep depressions which occur at intervals along the lines
    of both main and divisional walls. Even the chevron pattern has been
    irretrievably damaged by branches of trees growing outside the temple,
    while the little tower in the Sacred Enclosure has, within the last few
    years, been thrown over by a huge branch.</p>

  <p>But in 1902–4 all trees growing near walls were felled, all projecting
    branches and rotten limbs were removed, as well as all trees which
    caused damp to collect on walls, while a general thinning out was made
    of all branches which interfered with a general view all round the
    building. Such trees as had done all the possible harm they could do
    and all trees standing at a distance from walls were left standing.
    The result has been to make the temple less “picturesque” than in its
    neglected state, but it still remains picturesque. The temple now
    appears to be larger, and its massive proportions now made visible
    stand out far more prominently than before.</p>

  <p>The present trees appear to have been the first that ever grew within
    the temple area. In the soil removed from ancient floors there were
    no signs of any older generations of trees having existed. The first
    appear to have arrived with the soil brought in by the past Makalanga
    in the course of their usual practice of converting ancient enclosures
    into platforms on which to erect their huts. The trees evidently
    flourished in the soil made rich by huge piles of bones of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span> oxen and
    buck, the remains of feasts and sacrifices. Except in a few instances
    where rain-water was unable to escape, and has caused the ancient
    cement flooring to become decomposed, the roots of the trees rarely
    pierce below the ancient floors, the surfaces of which are covered with
    matted roots closely interwoven in masses like the roots of a large
    plant growing in a small pot.</p>

  <p>The jungle growth of small trees, bushes, and creepers would seem to be
    the result of excavators, who have broken up the hard clay floors of
    the old Makalanga and thus ventilated the soil below, as those places
    where most excavation work has been done have produced the greatest
    quantities of trees and the densest jungles. Until the whole of this
    foreign soil is removed down to the level of an ancient floor this
    jungle growth will always spring up afresh.</p>

  <p>But the growth of creepers such as monkey-rope, wild vines, and a
    climbing plant known as “Zimbabwe creeper,” has wrought untold havoc,
    but mainly on the faces of the walls. These creepers pierce into the
    joints of the dry masonry and emerge at a point some feet higher up.
    Later the branch inside the wall swells and forces out of the face of
    the wall all the blocks between the points where it enters into and
    emerges from the wall. This destruction of the walls by creepers is
    seen in many places at every one of the numerous ruins at Zimbabwe.
    Monkey-rope at the Elliptical Temple and wild vine on the Acropolis
    have been the most destructive agents of any of the creeper plants. The
    “Zimbabwe creeper” was found to be growing on the temple walls with
    its roots on the summits. This plant covered the main walls as with a
    thick green mantle, at some points completely hiding the entire surface
    of the walls. It also had its roots in the interstices of the Chevron
    Pattern, from the blocks of which it hung in festoons of over one
    hundred-weight each. This constant strain on the pattern has effected
    some destruction in addition to the injuries caused by the over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>hanging
    boughs of trees. The dilapidation of the walls of the Elliptical Temple
    is fairly typical of the dilapidations at all the ruins at Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p>But there are also minor causes for the dilapidation seen in the walls
    outside the larger ruins. The restless herd of some seventy cattle
    belonging to the Mogabe climb the lower walls with ease, and will walk
    along their whole length clanking the ancient blocks, and awkwardly
    clamber down broken ends of walls and gaps, bringing down a cataract
    of blocks as they descend. Some two hundred goats appear to live on
    the walls. Large baboons can be seen taking their morning exercise on
    the walls of the Acropolis, and as these scamper about and chase one
    another the blocks fall off the walls. Natives pull out the faces of
    the walls to secure honey, or in ferreting out small animals for food.</p>

  <p>It must also be remembered that the ancient walls have been quarried by
    Makalanga of past times and even by the present local Makalanga, all
    of whom have extensively used the ancient blocks for their inferior
    walls. But perhaps the greatest amount of dilapidation was effected
    when the large enclosed areas of the ruins were filled up and converted
    into raised platforms. In these instances, which are very numerous, the
    divisional walls suffered most, the blocks from their summits being
    thrown into the area till the interior was raised from 4 ft. to 7 ft.
    above the ancient floors, when clay floors were laid upon the filling
    in.</p>

  <p>On entering the Elliptical Temple of the Acropolis one of the first
    questions asked by visitors is—Are all these walls ancient? It is to
    the interest of our local archæological researches that such a question
    should be fairly dealt with, and the frank admission made that certain
    of the walls are not ancient. In examining the evidences against the
    antiquity of such walls a further proof is secured, were it needed,
    that such of the walls as are ancient possess undoubtedly the true seal
    of antiquity.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

  <p><i>Makalanga walls within ancient ruins at Zimbabwe.</i>—It would be
    preposterous to expect anyone who visited the ruins to believe that
    every single wall one saw at Zimbabwe, whether at the Elliptical Temple
    or on the Acropolis, was necessarily ancient.</p>

  <p>Some of the slighter-built walls within the ruins, which are of poor
    construction, and were once thought to be ancient, can now be shown
    to have been built by the Makalanga, the evidences of whose long and
    successive periods of occupation of these ruins are not only most
    obvious to all explorers and are confirmed by finds and conditions
    generally, but are a matter both of actual history as well as of
    tradition among the local natives themselves. Some of the ruins have
    been used by them for kraals, others—the smaller ones—were converted
    into cattle kraals with the huts outside the walls, while some have
    served both purposes. It is highly probable, judging by the state of
    the wall-débris, that the natives, in converting an ancient enclosure
    into a cattle kraal, have found portions of the divisional walls to be
    so dilapidated that they have rebuilt those portions after their own
    peculiar and recognisable fashion in order to keep in the cattle, at
    the same time building up gaps and entrances.</p>

  <p>While, according to statements of natives and judging also from the
    state of the ruins, there has been no occupation of the Elliptical
    Temple as a place of residence for the last three generations,
    still there are Makalanga walls to be seen, both here and in the
    Acropolis, at which latter ruins was the kraal, till four years ago,
    of the present Mogabe; and on the Acropolis are walls of Makalanga
    construction, both old and comparatively recent. The western enclosures
    of the Elliptical Temple have been used as cattle kraals up to the
    early seventies.</p>

  <p>The following are some of the evidences of Makalanga construction of
    walls within the ruins:—</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) The definite and circumstantial claim of the Makalanga<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span> to have
    built certain walls, and their ability to assign particular generations
    for the erection of other walls.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) The construction of such walls is identified with obvious
    Makalanga buildings in their kraals, where there are no ancient ruins.
    The purpose of the later walls is in many instances patent, especially
    when the smell of the modern byres still lingers in the soil of the
    areas used by natives as cattle kraals enclosed by such walls.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) Stones once part of the faces of ancient walls are used in the
    construction of those walls, the weather-stained, lichen-covered, and
    decomposed faces of the blocks being turned inside the walls either
    sideways or backwards, while the walls show no sign of age, and have a
    comparatively fresh appearance. Slate and granite monoliths, as well
    as ordinary slate beams which had once been lintels, have been used as
    building material.</p>

  <p>(<i>d</i>) Débris heaps of ancient blocks have been used as foundations, and
    sometimes these heaps acted as sections in the length of wall.</p>

  <p>(<i>e</i>) Frequently such walls are built in a very irregular line along
    the almost buried summits of ancient walls, and across filled-in
    entrances and even passages, the foundations of such walls projecting
    from underneath the Makalanga walls on either side.</p>

  <p>(<i>f</i>) Some of the Makalanga walls are built over damp, black leaf mould
    containing undecayed vegetable matter and also ordinary Kafir articles,
    the mould being over a stratum of red clay foundations of Makalanga
    huts, and with two or three feet of soil and stones between the clay
    and any floor below for which antiquity could be claimed. Makalanga
    pottery has been used to support and wedge up uneven ends of blocks.</p>

  <p>(<i>g</i>) The made foundations of Makalanga walls are of common clay, those
    of ancient walls being of a splendid quality of granite cement.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

  <p>(<i>h</i>) Nothing ancient or even approaching to antiquity is ever
    discovered on the levels of the bases of Makalanga walls, but round
    about their bases quantities of Makalanga articles may be found, some
    perhaps of better make and quality than now produced by them.</p>

  <p>(<i>i</i>) Local natives can to-day build very fair stone walls, but these
    have straight joints and are without tie or bonding, the courses are
    most erratic, and the line of wall wavering. The common feature of
    Makalanga wall construction is to build the stones up exactly over one
    another, giving the appearance to the wall of being built on columns.
    Their stone walls of cattle kraals can be seen in many deserted
    villages, as well as other of their walls where there are no ancient
    ruins. The Makalanga graves in the passages, both in the Elliptical
    Temple and in the Acropolis, were very well built in with cross-walls.</p>

  <p>(<i>j</i>) The Makalanga since mediæval times have always been known as
    builders in stone. Their circular hut and granary foundations of stone
    can still be seen in many parts of the country, especially on the
    clay floors of filled-in enclosures of ancient ruins of the terraced
    order. This art is mentioned by Mr. Selous and by almost all writers
    on this country before the Occupation, and pioneers and early settlers
    have affirmed this to be the case. Bent gives the names of Makalanga
    villages which he visited where these contained stone buildings of
    native construction. The names of other villages where such buildings
    are to be found are given by other writers. Bent actually saw their
    stone-building operations being carried on at Chipanza’s kraal.
    Professor Bryce describes a Makalanga village with stone buildings, but
    just as the arts of mining, smelting, wire-twisting, and cloth weaving
    are now fast disappearing on the advent of the cheap imported article,
    and on the natives finding other objects upon which to spend their
    time and labour, the art of stone building is becoming neglected. Old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
    pioneers visiting the ruins are unanimous in affirming that such walls
    so built and so conditioned are of undoubted Makalanga construction.
    There are stone buildings at Cherimabila’s kraal, nine miles west from
    Zimbabwe. Mr. Drew considers the Barotse to be now the best stone
    builders in this district.</p>

  <h3>OTHER WALLS NOT ANCIENT<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></h3>

  <p>But there are other walls in these ruins
    which are not believed to be ancient, and these have not been erected
    by recent generations of Makalanga, but possibly by mediæval Makalanga,
    or by Arabs, who had large influential colonies in this country,
    especially at the various Zimbabwes of the successive Monomotapas.
    The arguments against these walls being ancient are just as numerous
    and equally as cogent as those just enumerated, but the consideration
    of such walls is dealt with in detail in the description of the walls
    themselves.</p>

  <h3>REMAINS OF NATIVE HUTS FOUND IN THE RUINS</h3>

  <p>In many of the enclosures
    of the ruins at Zimbabwe are to be found on the present surfaces, and
    frequently, if the floor of the interior is not formed by the rock
    formation, on two floors beneath it, the remains of at least three
    entirely different descriptions of native huts. This is a feature
    constantly met with in ancient ruins throughout Southern Rhodesia,
    and in the early days of investigation these remains occasioned
    considerable perplexity to the explorer. In some ruins only one type of
    such structures is found, in others two classes of such dwellings, and
    in others three if not four different types of structure, all the three
    main types presenting different features in plan, construction, and
    material.</p>

  <p>That these erections are not ancient is a matter of ocular
    demonstration.</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) This is shown by their position on the clay floors laid over the
    débris which has been filled into the enclosure to the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>depth of
    from 3 ft. to 7 ft. above any ancient floor, hiding rounded entrances,
    passages, and smaller sub-divisional walls, and burying, as at some
    ruins, the ancient decorative patterns on the walls. The examination
    of the material employed, and the class of its make so similar to the
    remains of native huts in old deserted villages, all negative any
    suggestion of antiquity.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_152a">
    <img src="images/i_152a.jpg" width="436" height="550" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">AN OLD WALL CROSSING OVER THE FOUNDATION OF A STILL
      OLDER WALL, ZIMBABWE</div>

    <div class="caption">BINDING OF THE SUMMITS OF TWO SEPARATE WALLS, ACROPOLIS RUINS</div>
  </div>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) The stonework of the foundations is, as is shown later, of a
    totally different character from that in undoubted ancient walls, and
    is practically identical with the stone foundations of granaries still
    to be seen in any of the villages, some of which are not twelve months
    old.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) The “finds” in these structures do not suggest ancient
    occupation, but they include articles of superior native make and
    design, some of which are either not now used by Makalanga or Barotse,
    or are only met with in rare instances, but are claimed by local
    natives as having been made and used by previous generations of their
    people. For instance, double iron gongs, such as are plentifully found
    north of the Zambesi and in the higher Congo districts, where they may
    still be seen in actual use, pictures of which occur in works of travel
    in Central Africa; or copper bangles of exceedingly fine wire, which
    ornaments have fallen into desuetude and can be but seldom met with
    now; or carved soapstone daha pipe-bowls, for the making of which the
    Zimbabwe Makalanga, even at the time of the Occupation, were famous.</p>

  <p>(<i>d</i>) Several of these structures at Zimbabwe are claimed by the local
    Makalanga and Barotse to have been built by their respective people of
    previous generations. The Barotse lived on the Bentberg at Zimbabwe
    up to fifty or sixty years ago. The remains of their old kraal can be
    seen to-day. The circular shallow stone foundations of their huts,
    the courses rising in “cat-steps,” the immense rounded clay rims
    which supported the poles of the sides of their dwellings, are still
    in evidence. These were erected on platforms made by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span> filling in the
    spaces between the inner sides of ancient enclosure walls and the slope
    of the hill, a practice to be noticed on all the faces of Zimbabwe
    Hill, except the eastern.</p>

  <p>The different types of such structures so found in the ruins may be
    described as follows:—</p>

  <p>(1) The ordinary clay ruins of a present-day Makalanga hut, with clay
    floors, butt-ends of side poles still in position, clay ruins on floor
    marking off the fire-place, the stand for pots, the higher floor for
    sleeping-place of occupants and the lower floor for goats. These are
    found on the present surface or immediately under black leaf mould
    soil, and resemble huts built in local kraals, only they are neater,
    of better make, and of slightly superior quality of clay. The articles
    found here are similar to those belonging to present Makalanga.</p>

  <p>(2) The foundations of huts with large rims of clay with rounded
    edges on both sides, the diameter being some 9 ft. to 12 ft., and the
    rims 16 in. in length and about the same width, the poles being fixed
    along the centres of the rims. The material in the floor and in the
    rim is of a superior quality of clay, which builders state it would
    be misleading to describe as cement. Under the clay floors, which are
    about 3 in. thick, are platforms of stones laid flatwise in three or
    four courses, the outer faces of the courses receding from 1 in. to 3
    in. behind the faces of the courses below. Sometimes the stonework is
    laid upon a bed of clay. This class of hut is found upon a lower level
    than the undoubted Makalanga dwelling. In the Eastern Temple this type
    of remains was uncovered at a depth of 3 ft. below the surface, and
    there were no less than two clay floors, each with a layer of ashes,
    and two granite cement floors below it. These can be seen in the trench
    made alongside the stone foundation. Glass beads of old make, copper
    spearheads, and thick copper bangles, beaten copper and copper tacks
    were among the principal finds discovered in this type of building.
    In and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span> near such remains were found the four double iron gongs (May,
    1902-March, 1903), piles of animal bones split open in ordinary Kafir
    style for marrow, broken pottery, and quantities of ashes.</p>

  <p>(3) On still lower levels were found the floors and lower portions of
    the sides of huts made of a red-coloured cement without poles fixed in
    the cement sides. This is not ordinary daga. The inside faces of the
    walls, as well as the floors which are beautifully smooth, have been
    baked with fire, and fragments will ring almost like metal, portions
    having become white with the heat. This cement has in most instances
    been faced with a thin yellow glaze. On the floors are quantities of
    small rims very neatly bevelled, with three or four parallel faces on
    the top, the ends of the rims being rounded off. The bevelled rims
    are from 1½ in. to 4 in. wide. The roofs of these buildings were
    supported by poles inserted in the cement floors outside the huts at
    the distance in many instances of 1 ft. The posts round the outside of
    the huts were from 1 ft. 6 in. to 2 ft. 4 in. apart, and, judging by
    their butt-ends, which have been preserved by the cement, were made of
    hard woods, including mahobohobo, which is plentiful at Zimbabwe. The
    best examples of these huts, of which some score can be seen, are in
    No. 1 Enclosure in the Elliptical Temple, in the North-West Enclosure,
    Acropolis, and on the cleared section of floor in the Western Temple.
    These huts stand on cement platforms without stone foundations, and the
    platforms are about 1 ft. high, and the top edges are neatly bevelled.
    In two of these remains at Zimbabwe have been found gold dust, iron
    spring pincers with flux on the top, pottery, gold scorifiers, and the
    crudely-shaped soapstone moulds.</p>

  <p>Old pioneers assert that these buildings are of Makalanga construction.
    The Makalangas themselves claim these as having been built by their
    people in a very remote past. Similar buildings, but without traces
    of gold*smelting, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span> known to have been built by the Makalanga in
    different parts of Southern Mashonaland.</p>

  <p>Mr. Alfred Drew, Native Commissioner for Victoria district, who
    arrived in this country in 1890, and is a recognised authority on old
    Makalanga buildings, expresses his entire agreement with the above
    descriptions of old native clay huts, also with the conclusions arrived
    at concerning them.</p>

  <p>(4) There is another class of native hut which is not very frequently
    found in Southern Rhodesia, but is commonly met with in Basutoland
    and Swaziland, and in other territories further south. At Zimbabwe
    there are four such huts on the higher floors of filled-in ruins. This
    class of hut is constructed of cement of a good quality and of great
    thickness, with no poles to support the roof. It is circular in form,
    and from its exterior sides are four, sometimes five, short radiating
    walls of stones extending outward some 5 ft. or 6 ft. The walls are
    about 4 ft. wide, and in height reach almost to the top of the cement
    sides of the hut. The entrance usually has an immense cement buttress
    on either side, while between each radiating wall, and at the base of
    the side of the hut, runs a cement bevel rounded on its outer edge as
    if to form a seat. This bevel is about 14 in. high and 16 in. wide. In
    all weathers and at any time of day the occupiers could have sat in
    some one of these partially open spaces between the radiating walls
    sheltered from sun, rain, or wind. The remains of two such huts were
    found in the Western Temple on the Acropolis, and one of the radiating
    walls of one of them, which was more exposed and less ruined than the
    other short walls, was fixed upon by Swan as an “altar.” This wall is B
    wall, mentioned in the description of the Western Temple, which follows
    in Chapter XV.</p>

  <h3>PASSAGES</h3>

  <p>Every writer on Zimbabwe appears to have been greatly
    struck with the number of passages both at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span> Elliptical Temple and
    on the Acropolis, and particularly with their labyrinthine character.
    During 1902–4 further passages were discovered and opened out, and
    these had a total length of 2,130 ft. The total length of passages
    opened out, or which can be clearly traced, now amounts to 5,202 ft. As
    is shown later in this section, this by no means exhausts the tale of
    passages to be found at Zimbabwe.</p>

  <div class="center small mt2 mb5">* These passages were discovered in 1902–4.</div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

  <p>In addition to these totals of lengths of passages cleared out or
    traced, there are many other passages still buried in débris, the
    outcrop of their side walls being seen here and there on the surface
    near several ruins. Many, of course, must be completely buried under
    the veld, for some were lately discovered at least 3 ft. below the
    surface, with native paths crossing them in all directions, while it
    is quite reasonable to suppose that with the great area of ruins yet
    unexplored very many more passages will yet be found, especially when
    it is recollected that the discovery of one buried passage has most
    frequently led to the discovery of several side passages.</p>

  <p>Traces were found of two other passages leading from the base to the
    summit of the Acropolis Hill, and these remain unexplored, and each
    would be fully 900 ft. in length, while traces of several lines of
    passages are to be seen encircling at various heights the south, west,
    and north faces of the Acropolis Hill. These also at present remain
    unexplored.</p>

  <p>There are many points of interest concerning these passages:—</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) Passages were evidently constructed as part of the plan of the
    fortifications, but in some instances only as means of communication
    between certain buildings within the fortified area and for securing
    privacy. In the one class of passage buttresses and traverses are
    repeated with a marvellous redundancy; in the other class of passage
    not a single buttress or traverse is to be found.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) In passages leading from main ruins to exterior buildings the
    walls of the passage nearer the main ruins are better built, and the
    steps and floors are better constructed in the portions nearer the
    main ruins than are those of the more distant portions of the passage.
    So imperceptibly do the better-built portions merge into the less
    superior class of wall that it is extremely difficult to ascertain the
    exact point where the change in the quality of the construction takes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
    place, though the difference in the class of building at one end of
    the passage and that of the other is most obvious. But though this
    difference in the construction of the passage walls is so apparent,
    there is no suggestion that portions were of a later period, for
    they are built upon one plan, have one line of direction, serve as a
    complete communication with one obvious and particular point, and one
    length of the passage without the other would be purposeless, so far
    as the intention of the builders may be gathered. With regard to the
    passages ascending the Acropolis Hill, the completeness of the plan of
    these passages is best seen from the summit of the hill or from the
    summit of Makuma Kopje on the opposite side of the valley, from which
    heights respectively a complete view of those passages in their entire
    length is to be obtained.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) Excepting some of the passages in the Elliptical Temple and a few
    others on the Acropolis, all the passages at Zimbabwe are exceedingly
    narrow and tortuous, many being only shoulder wide, while, owing to
    their winding lengths, it is not possible to see many feet on ahead.
    Such of these passages as have their floors below the levels of
    adjoining enclosures have in many places their side walls bulged by
    the weight of earth and débris behind into the passage-ways, and in
    some such instances the side walls have collapsed and blocked up the
    passages.</p>

  <p>(<i>d</i>) Almost every passage appears to have originally been paved with
    blocks which were covered over with granite cement, but the cement,
    except in a few instances, has decomposed and been washed away by
    centuries of rains, though abundant traces of it remain.</p>

  <p>(<i>e</i>) Sunken passages built very much below the levels of the ancient
    floors on either side of them are numerous. The best instances of
    sunken passages are the North-East Passage between the Elliptical
    Temple and the Valley of Ruins, also the North-West Ascent to the
    Acropolis (upper portion),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span> and the sunken passage in the Eastern
    Temple on the Acropolis.</p>

  <p>(<i>f</i>) The walls of the ascents to the Acropolis as originally built
    would have precluded any outsider from seeing, even if standing on
    an adjoining kopje, the movements of people passing up and down the
    ascents; and to-day as a native ascends these passages it is almost
    impossible to see him till he reaches the summit, except as he is
    passing gaps or walls which have become considerably dilapidated. Some
    of the outer walls of these ascents are still 10 ft. in height.</p>

  <p>(<i>g</i>) The Elliptical Temple and the Western Temple on the Acropolis
    have each long and narrow and deep parallel passages on the inside of
    their main walls, and it is possible that the Pattern Passage served
    for a similar purpose at the Eastern Temple. The Parallel Passage in
    the Elliptical Temple communicated only between the North Entrance and
    the Sacred Enclosure where are the conical towers, and this passage has
    no communication with any other portion of the interior of the temple.
    Several of the known writers on these ruins, including Bent, have
    conjectured that these parallel passages in the temples were reserved
    for the use of the priests.</p>

  <p>(<i>h</i>) Cliffs and large boulders have been frequently utilised to form
    lengths of passages. Instances of this practice are to be seen on
    the Acropolis in the Rock Passage of the South-East Ancient Ascent,
    Buttress Passage, North Passage, and elsewhere. In some instances the
    walls are made to go out of their line so as to include neighbouring
    boulders, the sole object, so it would appear, being to deprive any
    invading force of the vantage offered by the height of the boulders for
    an attack to be made on the passage.</p>

  <p>(<i>i</i>) There are no evidences that any of the passages, except as stated
    later, were ever roofed. Possibly the winding stairs and the sunken
    passage in the Eastern Temple were originally covered over, as a great
    quantity of long, flat slate beams<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span> were found on their floors. It is
    believed that a single wall once crossed over the sunken passage in
    Platform Enclosure at about 15 ft. from its upper end, for when this
    passage was opened in 1902 slate beams were found at this spot, but at
    no other point in the passage. The passage through the main west wall
    of the Western Temple, which was blocked up by a Makalanga-built wall,
    of course, was covered over by the main wall, while the Covered Passage
    in the same temple remains intact as originally built. Moreover, the
    widths of many of the passages though narrow on their floors are
    wide at the summits of their side walls, and their irregular form
    precludes suggestion of any roofing having been placed over them, some
    being doubly as wide as the longest of the slate and granite beams
    found, beside which the general absence of long slate and granite
    beams on the floors of the passages would seem to further negative
    any such conjecture. The West Passage leading to the South Cave was
    not artificially roofed over, but the outer wall was raised up to the
    height of the boulder which overhangs the passage.</p>

  <h3>ENTRANCES AND BUTTRESSES</h3>

  <p>When in 1891 Bent approached Zimbabwe
    through North Bechuanaland, Gwanda, Tuli, and Belingwe, he passed
    through the centre of that area in which the earliest of the many
    ancient ruins of Rhodesia are located. All the ruins he described or
    mentioned had rounded ends of walls and rounded buttresses, all angular
    features being conspicuous by their absence. This fact appeared to
    him so striking that he was constrained, after comparing these ruins
    with Zimbabwe, to believe that such rounded features belonged to the
    earliest period of Zimbabwe architecture. Fully a score of competent
    writers on our ruins, whose valuable and trustworthy contributions,
    based on personal examination of the same area, have been welcomed by
    the leading scientific associations of Great Britain and Germany, are
    also emphatic as to the rounded entrances and buttresses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span> being one
    of the chief distinctive features of the earliest Zimbabwes. This is
    further demonstrated in the detailed descriptions of almost one hundred
    ruins within the same area which are given in <cite>The Ancient Ruins of
    Rhodesia</cite>, in the great majority of which ruins angular features,
    except in reconstructions of a later period, are altogether absent.</p>

  </div>

  <p>But the Great Zimbabwe being the finest type of that early class of
    ancient building, it may be interesting to know that Bent’s conclusion
    is thoroughly confirmed by these ruins.</p>

  <div class="center small mt2 mb5">* All rounded except three as so far discovered.</div>

  <p>All ends of walls which are still intact are rounded, there being only
    a few examples so far discovered of angular-ended walls.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i164">
    <img src="images/i_164.jpg" width="600" height="378" alt="" />

  </div>

  <p>The above figures show conclusively that these rounded features,
    excluding the ends of walls which are almost always rounded, are in a
    far greater proportion than 146 to 13 which are angular, and at least
    three of the latter, if not others, for reasons explained elsewhere,
    can be shown to have been erected at a much later period, one being
    built upon a floor of common Makalanga daga, and another débris
    containing ordinary Kafir articles of no very great age.</p>

  <p>All the entrances in the main outer walls, save one, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span> rounded, the
    few angular entrances being found, with two exceptions, in slighter
    walls, mainly divisional, some of which were erected later possibly to
    suit the immediate convenience of later occupiers, for divisional walls
    had been removed, reconstructed, or entirely fresh ones erected in new
    directions in almost every ruin, and in some instances the foundations
    of the later walls cross at right or oblique angles over the reduced
    summits of older divisional walls.</p>

  <p>Walls of the earliest period widen out as they near entrances. This
    feature is not present in plumb and angular walls of later construction.</p>

  <p>There is no evidence whatever in the rounded entrances that they were
    ever covered over, but in two angular entrances on the Acropolis the
    butts of the broken slate lintels still remain in the side walls.</p>

  <p>Although there are not sufficient proofs to enable one to definitely
    determine whether the rounded entrances as a rule were once covered
    over, some of the evidences to negative the covering in of rounded
    entrances may be noted:—</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) Had such entrances been roofed in, the collapse of the lintels
    must have brought down far more of the walls than have fallen.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) The courses of the blocks at the necessary height above the floor
    of the entrances on either side do not always correspond.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) The top courses near the summit of the walls on either side
    of the entrances show distinct signs of curving inwards towards the
    entrances. This is particularly noticed on the east side of the
    north-west entrance to the Elliptical Temple.</p>

  <p>(<i>d</i>) No splinters of slate or granite beams which could have been used
    as roofing were found in any of the very many rounded entrances.</p>

  <p>(<i>e</i>) Two intact rounded entrances, one open up to the summit on either
    side to a height of 19 ft., one entrance being at the east end of
    Pattern Passage on the Acropolis.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

  <p>No main entrance has buttresses on either hand on the outer side,
    possibly because these would have provided any attacking party with
    excellent shelter. All buttresses of such entrances are on the inside.
    Divisional entrances which have buttresses have them on the inside only.</p>

  <p>The entrances through a wall of the earlier period are carried over
    the common foundation in the opening forming the steps, which were
    evidently constructed before the side walls were erected. These steps
    are large, broad, and high, and where intact look most imposing. Such
    entrances resemble stiles, as they are much higher than the levels of
    the floors on either side.</p>

  <p>The entrances through an angular wall of a later period have steps
    which are not part of either side walls, but were built in after the
    entrance passage had been constructed, and these show poor workmanship
    and are very shallow, and recede only two to four inches. As the levels
    of the enclosures on either side have filled in over the original
    floors, such “cat-steps” have in some instances been built over the
    original large steps for the purpose of raising the floor of the
    entrances, seeing that the enclosures on either side had been filled in
    some feet above their original levels.</p>

  <p>Directly opposite the main entrance of the “Outspan Ruins” is a large
    circular buttress, as if it were intended to divide any attacking party
    into small numbers.</p>

  <h3>CAUSE OF DILAPIDATION TO ENTRANCE BUTTRESSES</h3>

  <p>The entrance buttresses
    with portcullis grooves are in most instances comparatively small, some
    projecting only two to three feet towards the interior of the building,
    and these are built up against main and divisional walls, and are in
    point of construction altogether independent erections, there being no
    dovetailing or binding between the buttresses and the walls.</p>

  <p>In some of the entrances the side lintels of slate, granite, and
    unworked soapstone beams have been found built into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span> the portcullis
    grooves. In <cite>The Ancient Ruins of Rhodesia</cite> it was noticed that at
    several of the ruins therein mentioned stone side lintels were found
    <i>in situ</i>. The stone lintel posts <i>in situ</i> at Zimbabwe had not then
    been discovered. The tallest of such stone lintels at Zimbabwe is 8 ft.
    above the ground. The buttresses appear to have been built after the
    stone posts had been erected, for the walls at the sides of the lintel
    follow the irregularities of the side faces of the beams.</p>

  <p>The great destruction which has occurred to these structures might
    possibly be accounted for by (1) the weight of the stone lintel on
    getting off the perpendicular, which would lever down the buttress into
    which it was built; (2) the foundations of buttresses are not so deep
    as those of the main wall up against which they were built; (3) when
    some later people, possibly natives, deliberately built up and blocked
    the entrances they might have used the blocks of these buttresses
    for their building material; (4) the passage-way between each pair
    of buttresses being so very narrow, damage could easily have been
    wrought by ordinary traffic; and (5) the main walls are much higher
    than the summits of the buttresses, and the walls on either side of the
    entrances being always more dilapidated on the summits, the falling of
    huge masses of masonry on to the buttresses immediately below might
    have effected their destruction.</p>

  <h3>DRAINS IN ELLIPTICAL TEMPLE</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap"><i>DRAINS through main walls</i>:—</p>

  <p>1. At (352 ft.);<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> from Parallel Passage to exterior of temple; has
    a decided fall outwards; curves round at half through towards south;
    covered with large slabs; inner hole 1 in. below granite cement floor

    raised step-barrier 4 in. high, 3 ft. 10 in. broad, from which the
    flooring slopes down to No. 2 drain, thus forming catchment areas for
    each drain to clear off rain-water, so that each drain only had such an
    area to clear which its capacity would allow.</p>

    interior opening buried in débris supporting wall threatening to
    collapse; exterior opening 10 in. high, 6 in. wide; covered with large
    slabs; exterior portion shows decided fall outwards; clear for 8 ft.,
    probably further.</p>

  <p>6. At (549 ft.); from No. 2 Enclosure to exterior of temple; clear for
    13 ft. from interior; exterior opening buried under very old Makalanga
    clay floor; covered with large slabs; interior opening 11 in. high, 8

    small conical tower; penetrated for 6 ft., at which point it is blocked
    up; rises sharply inside; exterior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span> opening 9 in. high, 6 in. wide;
    interior opening blocked up and covered over.</p>

  <p>9. At north end of South Passage; from South Passage to Parallel
    Passage; decided fall outwards; covered with large slabs; clear for
    5 ft.; interior opening 10 in. high, 8 in. wide; blocked up at outer
    opening by débris supporting dilapidated wall.</p>

  <p>[Pieces of granite cement lining also found here in 1892 and 1902.]</p>

  <h3>DRAINS AT ACROPOLIS RUINS</h3>

  <p>16. In Western Temple, in divisional wall “A” (see plan and
    description); drain-hole passes 5 ft. from north to south; northern
    opening 9 in. high, 11 in. wide; impossible to state the fall owing to
    stones and dirt inside; fragments of cement lining were found here in
    1891, 1892, and 1902. [The interior of this temple was on the north
    side of wall “A,” as well as on the south side of wall “D,” much higher
    than between these two walls, which form a small amphitheatre (Bent)
    within and at the west end of the larger amphitheatre formed by the
    main walls of the temple. This is obvious to anyone examining the
    interior. Practical builders have recently stated their belief that
    when the lower and western side of this smaller amphitheatre is cleared
    of débris drains will be found at the base of the main west wall,
    which, so far as discoveries have been made, is the widest ancient
    wall in Rhodesia. The whole interior of the temple, and the formation
    rock over which, but not upon which, it is built, slant at all points
    downwards to the foot of the inner face of the main wall.]</p>

  <h3>THE BATTERING OF WALLS</h3>

  <p>The backward incline of both faces of walls
    from their bases to summits is a general characteristic in ancient
    architecture at Zimbabwe, and in all other ruins which belong to the
    earliest known type of ancient buildings in this country. This feature,
    so far as examinations have been made, is conspicuous by its absence
    from all buildings of the second or later period. So noticeable is
    this feature in the main walls of the Elliptical Temple that visitors
    viewing the walls from the interior constantly affirm their belief that
    the walls have commenced to lean over towards the exterior, and when
    viewing the exterior faces of the identical walls declare that the
    walls are leaning inwards and must ultimately fall inside the building.
    This is a mere optical delusion.</p>

  <p>The main walls, portions of which are believed to have stood some
    3,500 years, are, if given the same conditions to which they have been
    subjected in past times, quite likely to be standing at the end of
    another millennium, if not longer, for the battering-back is a most
    important element of their massive strength, and has proved to be the
    main factor in securing their durability. Of course, some main walls
    in certain places show signs of bulging out and of damage caused by
    earth movements, possibly earthquakes, also by lightning, the sinking
    of foundations by water or damp, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span> growth of trees within their
    open dry masonry during the long period since their erection. Some
    faces of the walls show a complete swagging from end to end of their
    lengths, and yet the batter-back has preserved the walls practically
    intact throughout with each block occupying its original relative
    position. The appearance of such walls strongly suggests the effects of
    earthquake, and while these earth-movements would destroy a plumb wall,
    a wall with a severe batter-back, such as is seen in all the older
    walls at Zimbabwe, would on this account be comparatively safe from
    such effects.</p>

  <p>In some instances the battering is very severe and exceeds that of
    1 ft. in 6 ft., and the native labourers can scale such with ease.
    Looking at the rounded extremities of any of the most ancient walls,
    one notices that their sides resemble the lines of a lighthouse as
    popularly conceived, in many instances the batter-back being more
    severe near the base and near the summit, and many of such rounded ends
    of walls where still perfect show very graceful lines of battering. So
    carefully is the batter-back worked out in the courses that looking up
    or down the face of the wall one can scarcely see a quarter of an inch
    of face of protruding block out of the line of the battering.</p>

  <p>To secure the batter of the walls the blocks are not slanted downwards
    at their inner side, but are laid on a true dead level reaching from
    face to face of the wall on either side, and in their outer courses
    their outside edges are placed back from the outer course below. So
    slightly do these courses recede one above another that in the height
    of only a few courses it would be almost impossible to detect the
    presence of any battering, while it is very decidedly noticeable in a
    height of some few feet.</p>

  <p>Bent’s estimate of the extent of the battering of walls at Zimbabwe,
    namely, 1 ft. in 6 ft., is fairly exact with regard to many of the
    walls, but excessive with regard to others,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span> such as the main walls of
    the Elliptical Temple, while for many walls it is perfectly correct.
    The battering in most instances being more perceptible near base and
    summit than on the intermediate face of the wall, and the summits in
    many cases having disappeared, the batter-back, as ascertained by
    plumb lines, has consequently been considerably reduced. Where the
    original summits are still practically intact, and where there have
    been no bulging out of the faces of the walls, and the top courses on
    the edges do not lean outwards as they frequently do, on account of
    creeper and tree growths, the 1 ft. in 6 ft. is frequently approached,
    for instance, south wall <em>Western Temple</em>, 4 ft. 8 in. in 31 ft.;
    <em>Pattern Passage</em>, 2 ft. in 13 ft. In low walls 1 ft. in 6 ft. is very
    frequently reached.</p>

  <p>The main walls of the Elliptical Temple, as shown in the <cite>Table of
    Battering</cite> (see <cite>Elliptical Temple, Main Wall</cite>, Chapter IX.), are much
    less than 1 ft. in 6 ft., a fair average for inside faces being 1 ft.
    in 11 ft., but at some points it is only 1 ft. in 15 ft., and for
    outside faces 1 ft. in 10 ft. and 1 ft. in 8 ft.</p>

  <p>(For the battering of the <em>Conical Towers</em>, see descriptions of those
    structures.)</p>

  <h3>MONOLITHS</h3>

  <p>In most of the ruins of both major and minor importance
    at Zimbabwe, numerous beams of slate and granite, varying from 4 ft.
    to 14 ft. in length, have been found, some of the slate beams showing
    signs of having been treated with tools. It has been the custom of
    many writers to call these beams “monoliths.” In the greater number
    of instances these beams can be shown never to have been employed as
    monoliths. So far, at Zimbabwe, authenticated monoliths have been
    discovered only at the Elliptical Temple, and the Eastern and Western
    Temples of the Acropolis and Philips Ruins. Many of the beams found
    in these buildings are not and never were employed as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span> monoliths, and
    the greatest possible care has to be taken in discriminating between
    monoliths and ordinary beams.</p>

  <p>Monoliths have their bases marked and worn by the stones in the sides
    of the holes on the summits of the walls in which they now stand or
    once stood, as if they had later become loose and had moved or even
    oscillated constantly while still in a fairly upright position. The
    marking of such as have fallen shows that they were made by rubbing
    against the edges of the enclosing blocks when the monoliths were in a
    perpendicular position, while some of the jagged notches on the bases
    must have been made when the monoliths were in a slanting position.
    The stumps of beams left in the side walls of entrances and passages
    which were once covered by slate and granite lintels, and across which
    the upper portions of the walls were carried, do not show the same
    markings; in fact, such ends of slate and granite lintels are not found
    to be worn by the friction caused by contact with the edges of blocks,
    and besides, these lack all evidence of having occupied a perpendicular
    position, or of having been exposed to the weather. Monoliths are
    decomposed and weather-worn on all faces, but there is generally more
    lichen on their south faces.</p>

  <p>Further, the bases of monoliths, plain or carved, especially those
    of soapstone and slate, are found to have their lowest extremities
    water-worn into smooth faces or grooves at such points round their
    faces where the bases did not come in contact with the enclosing
    blocks, and this smoothing has obviously been caused by rain-water
    running down the faces of the monoliths to the lowest part of their
    bases, till at last, especially those of slate, the bases which
    were once of greater circumference have become worn and tapered.
    The thickness of the wall and the depth to which the bases of the
    monoliths were built into them would prevent the sun’s heat drying the
    damp bases, and would so keep them moist for a long time after every
    shower. This constant moisture has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span> caused the bases to splinter while
    the exposed portions of the monoliths remained practically intact.
    This water-wearing and the splintering on account of damp are absent
    in beams employed for any purpose in a horizontal position, and these
    usually show unmistakable signs of having been very well preserved from
    the effects of the weather, and the extremities of such beams do not
    taper, neither have they become splintered, and are usually as wide as
    the main portion of the beam.</p>

  <p>Undoubted monoliths of granite and slate have been found used by
    Makalanga as building material for their walls, and also as posts
    for cattle kraals. Also, in many cases, as posts for graves, and for
    decoration of Makalanga walls.</p>

  <h3>SOAPSTONE MONOLITHS AND BEAMS</h3>

  <p>Monoliths of soapstone have only been
    found in the three temples, but in greater profusion in the Eastern
    Temple on the Acropolis, and at Philips Ruins. Here they were found by
    their sections to have been of various diameters, but every one had
    been shaped with tools, some being artistically, others only crudely,
    decorated, but the majority were plain. Chevron pattern was evidently
    the favourite design employed. The Makalanga are believed to have
    used some of the broken sections of soapstone monoliths and beams for
    carving their <i>I-daha</i> pipe-bowls, in making which they are known to
    have excelled. This would save them the necessity of transporting the
    material to Zimbabwe from the soapstone formation, the nearest point of
    which is twelve miles in a north-western direction. Natives to-day have
    been seen taking away very small splinters of soapstone found in the
    débris heaps. These they cut with a knife into any crude shape that may
    be suggested to their passing fancy. The number of bases of soapstone
    monoliths is far greater than the number of splintered or broken
    sections found in the wall-débris heaps along the foot of the walls.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

  <p>Several sections of rounded soapstone beams were also found among the
    blocks on the summit of the main wall of the Elliptical Temple, and
    other sections were also discovered here in the débris at the foot
    of either side of the main wall. These sections, though plain, are
    beautifully finished, but being the lower portions above the bases, are
    without pattern. Probably the higher portions were decorated, as the
    decoration in several instances of soapstone beams discovered does not
    extend low down on the monoliths. The radii of the sections found in
    the Elliptical Temple varied considerably, while some had flat-worked
    faces with narrow ends artificially rounded.</p>

  <p>The discovery in all three temples of so many bases and sections of
    different sized soapstone monoliths suggests the question: Have the
    present standing slate and granite monoliths been, at any rate in some
    instances, erected at a later period to replace fallen or fractured
    soapstone monoliths?</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) Splinters of undoubted soapstone monoliths, some carved with
    geometrical patterns, have been found in large quantities in the lowest
    strata of wall-débris at each of the three temples only; sometimes they
    were found on the formation rock and below the wall débris, but at
    the foot of all the faces of the walls on the summits of which are at
    present only slate and unhewn granite are monoliths still more or less
    complete and erect.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) On the summits of walls on which are slate and granite monoliths
    numerous small fragments of rounded lengths of soapstone, identical
    with soapstone beams and some similarly carved, have been found. These
    instances were frequently noticed in all the temples, May-November,
    1902, but especially in the Elliptical Temple, where are now only
    granite and slate monoliths.</p>

  <p>Bent deduced from the various succeeding styles of Zimbabwe
    architecture that the ancient style of workmanship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span> changed its form
    some time between the period of the earliest builders and the later
    ones, and this would explain why the original monoliths were of more
    artistic form, with carvings and decorations. How far this has any
    connection with the theory of the probable substitution, patent, at
    any rate, in some instances, of plain and unhewn granite and slate
    monoliths for the fallen and ornate soapstone monoliths, it might be
    premature to enlarge upon at present, for, judging by the condition of
    the oldest walls on which certain granite monoliths are fixed, some of
    these monoliths sunk deep into the summits of the walls were obviously
    erected when the walls were originally constructed. For instance, one
    carved soapstone monolith was found built into a wall on the north side
    of the Western Temple to a depth of 5 ft., while the original height of
    the wall could not have been more than 8 ft.</p>

  <p>However, both ancient architecture and relics unquestionably prove that
    between the earliest and the latest periods of ancient occupation there
    was a marked falling off and decadence in the conception and erection
    of both buildings and in the character of the articles found.</p>

  <h3>NUMBER OF MONOLITHS STILL MORE OR LESS ERECT</h3>

  <p>The number of monoliths
    still erect, or which have fallen, is as follows, but the number may
    be further increased as the débris at the bases of the temple walls is
    examined:—</p>

  <p>At Elliptical Temple.—Nine granite monoliths still erect, nine fallen;
    no slate monoliths erect, five fallen; two granite monoliths, one of
    which is fractured, stand in No. 5 Enclosure.</p>

  <p>At Eastern Temple, Acropolis.—There are no soapstone monoliths now
    standing, but a considerable number of sections of slate and soapstone
    monoliths, including bases, were found in the débris. Mr. Posselt, who
    resided at Zimbabwe before the Chartered Company took possession of
    the country, states that in 1888 three soapstone beams,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span> with birds
    on their summits, were standing in the interior of the left-hand side
    of the West Entrance, and one at the northern end of the summit of
    the main east wall, on which is the dentelle pattern. The three beams
    stood on a small raised platform, and as this temple was then used as a
    cattle kraal, the cattle rubbed against them and eventually pushed over
    the beams.</p>

  <p>At Western Temple, Acropolis.—There are twelve slate and four granite
    monoliths still standing on the walls, and four slate monoliths, three
    still intact, have been found in wall-débris. Originally those on the
    south and west walls were exactly equi-distant. Bent found and removed
    several sections of different soapstone monoliths, both decorated and
    plain, but he found no soapstone bird in this temple. In 1891 the lower
    portion of a soapstone bird was discovered and taken to Johannesburg,
    and its whereabouts are at present unknown. In August, 1902, the head
    and neck of this same bird were found, as also a length of the beam
    upon which it stood, and this is beautifully carved with chevron
    pattern. This beam originally stood on the summit of the north wall.</p>

  <p>All slate monoliths are plain, but many of those of slate have been
    rounded with tools of which they bear the markings.</p>

  <p>Several monoliths have fallen since 1888. One immense granite beam
    which occupied an upright position immediately north of <em>The Platform</em>
    in the Elliptical Temple has disappeared since 1891. A monolith in
    the interior facing the <em>Western Entrance</em> has fallen within the last
    few years, while a tall granite beam at the same spot has broken off
    just above the ground within the same period. Another tall granite
    beam occupied the <em>Central Area</em> in the temple, and this has also
    disappeared within the last seven years.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Relic prospec<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>tors of the
    nineties appear to have excavated round the spots occupied by monoliths
    and caused their fall.</p>

  <p>The finest specimen of a bird on a soapstone beam yet discovered at
    Zimbabwe was found by the author in <em>Philips Ruins</em> in February, 1903.</p>

  <h3>SLATE AND GRANITE BEAMS.</h3>

  <p>These are plentifully found in all the
    enclosures. Sections and splinters of slate beams are found in
    entrances which have portcullis grooves, one still standing in
    position 8 ft. above the floor. Slate beams used as entrance posts in
    portcullis grooves were erected before the building of the entrance,
    as the enclosing blocks follow the irregularities of the beams. Wood
    posts found in some portcullis grooves in poorer built walls are not
    considered ancient, and their comparative modernity is testified to by
    experienced builders who have very recently examined a collection of
    such posts. Mopani hard wood and mahobohobo have not been used in all
    such instances, some of the posts being of soft wood. Wooden posts have
    not so far been found in well-built entrances. The posts outside the
    clay huts of old Makalanga are older in appearance and condition than
    the majority of the posts found in the poorer entrances, though they
    very closely resemble one another in measurements and in the wood used.
    In one instance the groove was too large for the wooden post which had
    been wedged in with granite splinters, the granite being only slightly
    weathered.</p>

  <p>Slate and granite beams were also employed for the bonds and ties of
    walls, also for ties in sharply curved walls, also for supporting the
    roofs over covered passages.</p>

  <p>The nearest point to the slate formation is seven miles in a
    north-easterly direction. It is believed that the long granite beams
    were brought from the Lumbo Rocks, one and three-quarter miles to the
    south, where a great quantity of exactly similar shaped beams are to be
    seen lying scattered round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span> the high perpendicular column of granite,
    the sides of which split off into the shape of the long monoliths found
    on the Acropolis.</p>

  <h3>CEMENT DADOES</h3>

  <p>One of the discoveries made recently in clearing the
    lower portions of interior faces of walls from débris, which appears to
    have covered them for centuries, is that some portions of such walls
    have been found to be covered with the remains of excellent granite
    cement dadoes. This is particularly to be noticed on three walls of the
    <em>Sacred Enclosure</em>, on the south wall of <em>No. 11 Enclosure</em>, and at the
    <em>Little Enclosure</em> and the <em>Upper Passage</em> on the Acropolis, and in
    other ruins where portions of this dado still remain.</p>

  <p>These dadoes extended to a height of 7 ft., the cement being found in
    patches still intact and in the joints of the blocks to this height,
    the courses above this height being entirely free from traces of cement.</p>

  <p>In passages and narrow places great quantities of this cement lay on
    the original floors along the bottoms of the walls on either side, some
    fragments showing on their backs the ribbed markings of the courses
    up against which the cement had been pressed, also bevelled edges, as
    if from the top and ends of such dadoes. This was particularly the
    experience on clearing out the <em>Parallel Passage</em> in the Elliptical
    Temple. It is possible that these dadoes had once facings of white
    soapstone clay, beautifully smoothed, for this was found on some
    fragments of such cement dadoes, and the facing, when cut with a knife,
    powdered exactly as soapstone does.</p>

  <p>It can be noticed by anyone that the lower portions of the walls which
    once had dadoes have their block faces somewhat roughly built as
    compared with the upper portions of the walls. This appears to suggest
    that the original builders, in erecting the wall, had calculated upon
    certain portions of the faces being covered with dadoes. These rougher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
    surfaces would provide a better hold for the cement than would the
    smoother faces of the walls above.</p>

  <p>The cavities in the dry masonry of the main walls of the Elliptical
    Temple contain cooled air even at noontide, and this rushes out from
    between the courses with such a force as to make it impossible to light
    a match close to them, while it is a very easy matter to carry on a
    conversation through a wall 15 ft. thick and 32 ft. high.</p>

  <p>To the original builders who, as is shown elsewhere, thoroughly
    understood and appreciated the art of sanitation, it is quite probable
    that these dadoes were considered necessary, especially as these dry
    masonry walls are the homes of snakes, lizards, and other unpleasant
    reptiles and creatures which probably were more abundant here three
    thousand years ago when, as competent scientists affirm, the climate
    was more humid. Whether for the exclusion of sound, for the securing
    of privacy, for the protection of their dwellings from reptiles, or to
    avoid the tearing by rough granite blocks in very narrow passages of
    such garments as they might have worn, or for the purpose of artistic
    effect—and these ancients practised several fine arts—the fact has
    recently been revealed that at any rate some of the ancient walls were
    once covered with these cement dadoes.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

  <h3>BUILT-UP CREVICES</h3>

  <p>On the Acropolis Hill cliffs and boulders form
    such prominent features that these have often been employed as sides
    of enclosures. The ancients were in many instances at great pains to
    build up crevices and fissures in rocks, especially where these are in
    or near the enclosures. Even small crevices only a foot or so wide,
    and penetrating into the face of the cliffs and rocks for but two
    or three feet, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>the front being the only part giving access to such
    fissures, are carefully built up flush with the face of the rock. Some
    large perpendicular fissures in the cliffs have been so built up to an
    immense height. One fissure on the south side of the Rock Holes Path
    has been built up for 40 ft. above the ground. This fissure is from 1
    ft. to 3 ft. wide. The effect caused by this column of blocks running
    up the face of the cliff is very strange. Some fissures are so narrow
    that very small blocks have been used. From some of such fissures the
    built-up courses have fallen away, leaving a few courses, here and
    there at different heights wedged in between the sides of the fissures,
    and occasionally one sees a single block wedged into a fissure at
    an immense height above any ruin. This building-up of crevices and
    fissures is to be found almost over the whole face of the hill where no
    ruins are now to be seen. If two boulders are near together, it may be
    taken as almost a moral certainty that on examining the boulders they
    will be found to be connected with a wall, even if the space be only a
    foot or two wide.</p>

  <p>In a similar manner the holes under overhanging boulders have been
    neatly built up so as to effectually hide the hole. The natives have in
    two or three instances removed sufficient of the blocks to enable them
    to pass a corpse through, after which, with their peculiar style of
    building—column form—they have filled up the gaps with walling.</p>

  <h3>HOLES IN WALLS OTHER THAN DRAINS</h3>

  <p>This peculiar feature of ancient
    architecture is especially prominent at the Acropolis, also in East
    Ruins, and in almost all the ruins in the Valley of Ruins. There
    are holes, generally square, in the lower parts of the walls at two
    or three feet above any ancient floor. They are found only on the
    inside faces of walls, not one as yet having been discovered on the
    outer face. That they are intentionally made is a matter of ocular
    demonstration, for many have lintels either of large granite slabs or
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span> slate beams. The blocks of the side framings are all built flush
    with each other. Their peculiarity is that they do not extend back
    into the wall for more than the length of a block, in one case of two
    blocks, and the internal packing blocks in the wall are seen inside.
    One such recess on the Acropolis shows traces of having once been lined
    with granite cement. The bottom portion of a similar recess in Upper
    Passage also has remains of cement lining. The largest recess is to be
    seen on the west side of a divisional wall in East Ruins. This is 3 ft.
    high and 1 ft. 10 in. wide. No such recess has so far been discovered
    in the Elliptical Temple, but at least fifty have been found elsewhere
    among the ruins.</p>

  <h3>BLIND STEPS AND PLATFORMS</h3>

  <p>In several enclosures in the principal
    ruins at Zimbabwe, but mainly at the Elliptical Temple, and in the
    angles formed by the meeting of side walls of the enclosures, are to
    be seen small raised platforms approached by two or three steps. These
    steps could not have led to higher positions than the small platforms,
    that is, they could not have been intended for mounting to the summit
    of the wall, for the bottom steps are at far too short a distance from
    the walls in comparison with their heights, besides which, the steps
    and platforms are perfect in themselves, and their summits, judging by
    the condition of the cement floor, terminated as is seen to-day. Nor
    are there any signs on the faces of the walls above such platforms of
    any steps, or that the blocks in the angles of the walls were at any
    time protected from the weather by any higher structure.</p>

  <p>These blind steps surmounted by miniature platforms are made of blocks
    thickly covered with granite cement similar to that found on the lowest
    floors of the temple—the steps being large and deep and boldly rounded
    off. The shape of these erections reminds one of the steps and raised
    platforms which are frequently seen in stableyards at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span> home, and were
    once very generally used as mounting blocks.</p>

  <p>Bent, unfortunately, discovered only one of these platforms, and this
    was the one on the north side of the Sacred Enclosure (west), and when
    he saw it the platform was covered with débris, evidently débris,
    judging by its age, put there by Dr. Mauch, who had been exploring
    in this portion of the enclosure. This débris was foreign to this
    particular spot and had evidently been removed from nearer the Conical
    Tower. Bent therefore conjectured that these blind steps once led to
    the summit of the south wall of The Platform. The height of the wall
    here, 12 ft., could not have been surmounted by these steps, for if
    carried upwards with the same class of step as below, they would have
    failed to reach half-way up the wall.</p>

  <p>These erections might have served a similar purpose for the enclosures
    in which they were erected, as did the large Platform immediately
    in front of the Conical Tower for the whole of the Temple. The best
    examples are in the north-east corner of No. 12 Enclosure, the south
    corner of No. 7 Enclosure, both in the Elliptical Temple, and in the
    south-east corner of the Western Temple and in the north, east, and
    west angles of the Eastern Temple, both on the Acropolis. Possibly the
    platform and steps in the South Passage of the Elliptical Temple were
    used for a similar purpose, for this latter structure, though not built
    into any angle of walls, is of exactly similar construction to the
    others.</p>

  <h3>ANCIENT WALLS AT A DISTANCE FROM ANY MAIN RUINS ARE OF A LESS SUPERIOR CONSTRUCTION</h3>

  <p>There is another class of building found in
    walls erected at a distance from any main ruins, and these, though
    constructed in a somewhat rougher form, are otherwise all built upon
    the principles of the First Period of Zimbabwe architecture. These
    walls can be clearly shown to have formed part of the original purpose,
    plan, and con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>struction as the main ruins, and prove that the original
    ancient builders, while devoting their best skill to the temples and
    residential portions of the building, were satisfied with a somewhat
    inferior quality of workmanship for their more distant walls, and for
    such of their outlying buildings as were used for some purpose, judging
    by the finds, other than those of workshop or residence, most probably
    as forts, workshops, stores for grain, or as the housing places of
    slaves.</p>

  <p>The close connection between the well-built walls of the main ruins
    and these outlying walls and buildings is, in many instances, easy to
    establish, and this may be shown as follows:—</p>

  <p>1. The sole difference between the construction of the main ruins and
    the outlying buildings lies in the quality of workmanship and material,
    these outlying walls showing all other features of first-period
    architecture to the exclusion of any feature of the second or later
    periods of construction.</p>

  <p>2. Connecting passages between the inner portions of main ruins and
    the outlying buildings are well built in and near the main ruins, but
    are excellently constructed as distance is reached, though the line of
    foundations throughout, as also the cement flooring, are one and the
    same.</p>

  <p>3. Undoubted ancient floors are laid up to and against such walls.</p>

  <p>4. Relics of prehistoric character, similar to those discovered within
    any of the main ruins, have been found beyond main walls in connecting
    passages and in the more distant ruins.</p>

  <p>These evidences as to the early period during which some of the more
    distant walls were erected are also found in other large ruins of
    Southern Rhodesia, but at Zimbabwe, where the Acropolis affords such
    a commanding view of the lines of walls of the outer ruins and of the
    directions of recently unburied passages of great length, and of the
    sweep of the walls connecting main ruins with outlying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span> buildings, the
    original purpose of many of the walls and minor ruins appears to be
    very manifest.</p>

  <p>In these outer walls the blocks are of far greater size, their shape
    is frequently irregular, and unhewn stones are employed, but their
    faces are even on either side and the internal parts are neatly filled
    in with stones. All these walls have the usual Zimbabwe batter-back,
    have rounded entrances, and the steps are not built in between the side
    walls, but are formed by the courses of the foundations. Plumb walls
    and angular entrances are very rarely met with.</p>

  <h3>CEMENT</h3>

  <p>The original builders of the Zimbabwe ruins, as well as
    those of later ancient periods, can be seen to have shown a peculiar
    partiality for the employment of cements for all constructive work save
    that of building the walls, which are all, without exception, of dry
    masonry. Evidently the ancients, judging by the immense quantity of
    cement work throughout the ruins, much of which is still in splendid
    condition, deliberately avoided the use of cement in the construction
    of the walls. Probably in this respect, and in the employment of blocks
    of a certain size, they were but following the methods of building to
    which they were accustomed before their arrival in this country.</p>

  <p>(1) The cement work of the oldest periods has been pronounced by
    practical builders to have been made of crushed fragments of decomposed
    granite mixed with a large proportion of lime, the latter being found
    in Suku Glen (see <i>Suku Glen</i>) in extensive areas. This cement is
    exceedingly hard, and has a glaze on the outer surface which, once
    broken, has caused the internal body of cement to rapidly decompose
    into yellow soil. Thus on the faces of steps, dadoes, and all
    perpendicular work, the cement is more intact, while on flat surfaces
    where rain-water could not be carried away owing to the stopping up of
    drains the cement floors are in many instances considerably ruined.
    Tree roots are rarely found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span> to have penetrated any cement floor which
    was in a whole condition, and where a root has so penetrated the
    cement, the root, acting as a conductor of water, has caused all the
    cement along the line of root to become decomposed. All the roots of
    trees which have recently been removed from above cement floors are
    flat, while some of them assume the shape of the structure that was
    underneath. In one instance the roots of an immense fig tree, which was
    thought to be over one hundred years old, had wound round and round a
    circular cement platform which they had failed to penetrate.</p>

  <p>This class of cement has been very extensively used by the older
    occupiers for (<i>a</i>) flooring, (<i>b</i>) dadoes, (<i>c</i>) covering steps and
    platforms, (<i>d</i>) construction of steps and platforms made entirely of
    cement, (<i>e</i>) raised rims for dividing floors into separate catchment
    areas, so confining rain-water over certain areas to particular drains,
    (<i>f</i>) foundations of walls, (<i>g</i>) for short, low divisional walls made
    entirely of cement.</p>

  <p>(2) There is another class of granite cement which closely resembles
    the first-mentioned, and this is found on the higher levels. It is
    also yellow, but in it occur pieces of granite, and it has a decidedly
    coarser appearance. This is not so lavishly laid, being only one or
    two inches thick, whereas the former cement is most frequently found
    to have a thickness of at least 6 in., that is, in those instances
    where the structures are not entirely composed of this cement. A great
    quantity of this cement work can be seen on the Acropolis or in the
    Valley of Ruins.</p>

  <p>(3) A further class of cement is of a dull reddish colour, containing
    more soil than granite. Practically it is clay, but so fine and well
    polished that it deserves the designation of cement. This work had been
    burnt white, and its material is very strong and far superior to the
    best clay used by the oldest native occupiers.</p>

  <p>(4) A greyish-coloured cement, in which there are large proportions of
    lime. This is found in ruins. On the summit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span> of Rusivanga Kopje there
    are floors and walls made of it. There is difference of opinion between
    builders and native authorities as to the makers of this cement. It is
    most certainly superior to any such material made by the natives of
    to-day. It closely resembles, if it is not identical with, the material
    used in building the two classes of huts Nos. 1 and 2 (see <cite>Native huts
    found in ruins</cite>). The natives state it is not of any known Makalanga
    make. It is found in large slabs, as if from the side walls of circular
    huts, fully 14 ft. in diameter, also in bevelled ruins of all sizes.
    This cement can be seen in some of the ruins, also on Zimbabwe Hill,
    where the natives state there has been no occupation, excepting, of
    course, Mogabe’s brief residence, for at least five generations.
    Judging by the high-class quality of Kafir “finds” here, it is quite
    possible that this cement is that of the mediæval Makalanga.</p>

  <p>(5) The other descriptions of <i>daga</i> (clay) vary in quality from
    fairly good to most inferior. These are mere veld soil, without being
    mixed with lime, and are seen in portions of distinctly old Kafir huts
    resembling the types Nos. 2 and 3. It is also to be found in quantities
    on the Bentberg and on Rusivanga Kopje. In many trenches can be seen
    three or four layers of this <i>daga</i> one above another, each layer being
    about one inch thick, and there are layers of ashes between the floors.</p>

  <h3>ANCIENTS AND CAVES AND ROCK HOLES</h3>

  <p>There are innumerable rock holes,
    chasms, and large fissures among the cliffs and boulders of the
    Acropolis Hill, but there is only one—the Balcony Cave—that actually
    deserves the title of cave, though this name is bestowed upon them all
    by several writers. Perhaps Balcony Cave approaches nearest to the
    general conception of what is a cave. But the holes under beetling
    boulders which constitute these “caves” are as a rule shallow, low, and
    narrow.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

  <p>There are no evidences in any of these holes, so far as they have been
    examined, that the ancients cut into the rock or quarried to make or
    improve these holes, the faces of the rock being all natural, and
    devoid of any traces of their having been worked. Sir John Willoughby
    makes a similar statement as to the rock never having been cut. It is
    also noticeable that small spurs of formation rock jutting up through
    the floors of enclosures have never been cut away. But the ancient
    builders were very clever in artificially improving the fronts of the
    rock holes, so as to add extra space to the size of the holes. This
    was done in at least two instances, though there are traces of its
    having been done elsewhere. A wall was built at some feet immediately
    in front of the hole, and this was carried up so high that its summit
    was connected with the cliff or boulder which rose above and arched
    outwards in front of the hole. This is seen at South Cave, where a wall
    was carried up to the over-arching boulder, thus more than doubling the
    area of the cave (see descriptions of each cave).</p>

  <p>There are a series of such rock holes on the north-east side of the
    hill and on the south of Rock Holes Path. The covered holes between
    the large boulders look very romantic, and their appearance suggests
    the probability of there being large caves here, but the appearance is
    most deceptive. The greatest number of such hollows are to be found at
    the east end of the Acropolis Hill, and some few of these are worth
    visiting, but the irregular and rugged contour of that face of the
    hill makes climbing there a most difficult matter, besides which our
    labourers have recently killed two tiger-cats at these holes, and they
    state that there are more of such animals there.</p>

  <p>Some few only of the caves near the main ruins of the Acropolis have
    had cemented floors, the formation rock being in most instances
    sufficiently smooth and level to make it unnecessary to lay cement
    floors. Platform Cave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span> has at least three levels of cement flooring one
    above another.</p>

  <p>The purposes for which these caves have been used cannot be determined,
    for the finds made in them were very meagre and common, most being
    Makalanga hoes, spearheads, brass wire bangles still containing hair or
    grass, and fragments of pottery of poor and modern make. The only caves
    which yielded anything of antique character were Platform and Balcony
    Caves. In the former were sections of soapstone monoliths and fragments
    of soapstone bowls. In the latter were about a dozen large slate beams
    and plain soapstone beams. The soil in this cave has often been panned
    by visitors, as there has always been an idea that gold dust was once
    stored here. Almost all the pannings showed faint traces of gold, and
    one or two rather richly. Theodore Bent, Sir John Willoughby, and also
    many searchers for relics, have practically cleared the most important
    of these caves of all finds.</p>

  <p>A cave hole under an immense boulder on the south side of the Gold
    Furnace Enclosure is about 15 ft. square, but one has to crouch low
    down to move about in it. Here have been found quantities of quartz,
    copper ore, and ironstone, pieces of beaten copper and copper wire,
    sections of gold crucibles, and pottery whorls. No industry could
    have been carried on in this low-roofed area, but gold-, copper-, and
    iron-smelting were evidently conducted in the adjoining and higher Gold
    Furnace Enclosure, and this hole or chasm, as Bent calls it, was used
    for depositing the debris from such furnaces.</p>

  <p>Nearly all the rock holes on Zimbabwe Hill had been used for some
    purposes—up to four years ago by the Makalanga as burial-places, the
    hill abounding in such graves. Now the local Makalanga are prohibited
    burying on this hill, and at the same time their kraal was removed from
    the Acropolis. The bodies were placed in the corners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span> of these rock
    holes and piled over with stones; the pot, assegais, knobkerries—and in
    one instance a large bark-string hunting-net, 5 ft. high and about 30
    yds. long—which belonged to the deceased, were laid upon the top of the
    stones.</p>

  <p>There are no Bushman paintings in any of these caves, nor on the
    immense rocks which are strewn all over the hill. Nor does the district
    round about possess any of these paintings. Almost every kopje within
    a few miles of Zimbabwe has very recently been carefully examined for
    walls, relics, caves, and paintings, several of the hills having been
    within the last few months ascended several times from various points.
    Natives, farmers, and prospectors state that these are altogether
    absent from this portion of the Victoria district.</p>

  <p>But caves and rock holes are very numerous on some of the kopjes which
    are within an easy walk of the ruins, and if some of these were cleared
    out some discoveries might possibly be made. It will be recalled that
    both the ancient cylinder with rosettes, the wooden platter with the
    signs of the zodiac, and the notorious pot “Fuko-ya-Nebandge” were all
    found in caves at some little distance from Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap"><i>PLAN of main wall.</i>—Though popularly spoken of as the “Circular
    Temple,”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> the building is of elliptical plan, “a form of temple,”
    says Bent, “found at Marib, the ancient capital of the Sabæan kingdom
    in Arabia, and at the Castle of Nakab al Hajar, also in that country.”
    The resemblance between the temple at Marib and the Elliptical Temple
    at Zimbabwe is remarkable, and several scientists of repute, who have
    considered the plans of both these ruins, emphasise the remarkable
    resemblance, not only in the plan, but in the forms of worship
    practised by the ancients, as evidenced also by the relics discovered
    at both temples. For instance, Professor Müller, of Vienna, the great
    South Arabian archæologist (<i>Burgen und Schlösser</i>, ii. 20.) compares
    these two ruins as follows:—</p>

        <td class="tdp">
          <p>Highly probable that Zimbabwe was a Sabæan Almaquah
            temple, as it is orientated and geometrically built for astronomical
            purposes, as in all cases of such buildings used for the
            worship of Almaquah. Sacred birds found at Zimbabwe are
            said to represent Venus the “Morning Star.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
          </p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Herr Brugsch believes the images of the birds found at Zimbabwe
    emphasised a Sabæan occupation, while M. Naville is especially of
    opinion that there exists a strong connection between Venus, the star
    of the Sabæans, and the goddess worshipped at Zimbabwe. The evidences
    pointing to the close connection of the South Arabian temples and
    Zimbabwe are almost inexhaustible. On this point Bent and Schlichter
    are at one with each other (see <cite>Petermann’s Mitteilungen</cite> 1892; also
    <cite>The Gold of Ophir</cite> by Professor A. H. Keane; and M. Arnaud’s plan of
    the temple at Marib).</p>

  <p>Professor Müller also states that the elliptically formed wall appears
    to have been always used in the temple buildings of ancient Arabia, and
    states that at Sirwah the Almaquah temple is built in an oval form. In
    these old temples, he says, sacred inscriptions to the deities were set
    up on stylæ (stone beams). At Zimbabwe some scores of carved soapstone
    beams have been discovered in the three temples, also ten birds perched
    on tall soapstone beams and three other birds detached from their
    beams, also four miniature birds on pedestals carved out of soapstone.</p>

  <p>The Elliptical Temple at Zimbabwe is a much larger building than that
    at Marib, having a circumference of about 833 ft. as against the 300
    ft. of the Marib temple.</p>

  <p>On entering the building it is at once seen that the most massive
    and excellently constructed portions of the main <span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>wall extend
    from slightly north of the North Entrance to the east and south and
    south-west, and that the other portions, particularly the north-west
    and west, are slighter, and though showing fairly good workmanship,
    it is not nearly so well built as the other portion of the wall, the
    average width of the summit of the poor wall being barely a third
    of the average width of the better-built portion. The general line
    of the summit is also fairly level, but it averages some 5 ft. to 8
    ft. less in height than that of the northern and eastern walls. The
    distinct character of the two portions of the main wall is very plainly
    noticeable on viewing the temple from the summit of the Acropolis Hill.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow600" id="i_194">

    <div class="attribr">Methuen &amp; Co.</div>
    <div class="caption">THE ELLIPTICAL TEMPLE<br />Great Zimbabwe</div>
  </div>

  <p>But this temple does not stand alone in showing its main wall massive
    and exceptionally well built at one point of its circumference and
    slighter built on the other part. This feature is common to many ruins
    in Rhodesia, excepting, of course, ruins of forts and those ruins
    built upon the angular plan and terraced. Bent was fully aware of this
    feature, and cites instances of its occurrence. Mr. Swan does the same,
    and so does Schlichter. At some time or another before the north-west
    and west wall was built that portion of the original wall had become
    dilapidated, and the temple had become “half-moon,” “section of a
    circle,” or “crescent” shaped, these being the terms applied by all
    writers, without exception, to such of the circular ruins in the First
    Period Ruins’ Area,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> where portions of the main wall had fallen down.
    The published plans of ruins demonstrate this fact. Probably Zimbabwe
    will again become a “section of a circle,” for it stands to reason that
    the weaker wall will be the first portion to disappear.</p>

  <p>The massive and well-built portions of the ruins, built upon a system
    of curves, almost always bear the mural pattern of the oldest types,
    while the slighter portions are without <span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>pattern. It is so at Marib,
    it is so at Zimbabwe, and it is so in some score of ruins built upon
    the same principles, as shown in the Elliptical Temple. This has been
    found to be so invariable a rule that on sighting a building of this
    class of ruin even at some distance one can almost fix the position
    of the pattern, that is, if the wall is not so reduced in height that
    the decoration, if originally any, has not disappeared. Assuming no
    principle of orientation to attach to such ruins, there yet remains
    something to be done in explaining the directions of the massive curved
    and decorated walls of the circular ruins, for the existence of so many
    scores of parallelisms can hardly be explained away as being but so
    many coincidences.</p>

  <p>It has now (June, 1903) for the first time been shown by ocular
    demonstration that the slighter wall, though ancient, is a
    reconstruction of a still more ancient wall which curved outwards more
    to the north and north-west. Recently some thirty tons of granite
    blocks which lay in the gap on either side of it were removed, and the
    foundations at this spot uncovered, showing the meeting in a mis-joint
    at an oblique angle of two distinct walls, the foundations of the
    massive north wall being 9 ft. 10 in. wide, and that of the later wall
    6 ft. wide, while the class of building in the two walls is obviously
    distinct. The face of the end of the north wall was extended further
    outwards towards N.W. 40 ft., and the line of its foundation, according
    to its curve, points in that direction, where, it is believed, the old
    extended foundation has been come upon at 36 ft. outside the later
    wall. The slighter wall approaches the massive wall from W. 80. The
    bases of the foundations are practically on the same level.</p>

  <p>Though the later wall is not so well constructed as the older wall, it
    must not be taken as poorly built. (See “<cite>Construction of main wall</cite>,”
    later.)</p>

  <p>The wonderful feature is that no joint in the wall has so far been
    discovered in its south-west portion. Practical builders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span> who have
    examined the wall on this side for such a joint are perplexed at
    not being able to discover it, and some consider, from certain
    circumstances noticeable, that it must have been at the West Entrances
    where this later wall was commenced, in which case no such joint would
    in all probability be found.</p>

  <h3>CONSTRUCTION</h3>

  <p>The construction of the main wall from the north to the
    east, and round to the south and south-west, is admittedly by far the
    finest specimen of ancient constructive work yet found in Rhodesia; it
    has consequently been made the standard by which the best-known writers
    and greatest authorities judge of the quality of the work shown in
    other walls in the country. Certainly two large and important ruins in
    the Lower Sabi Valley, which are much larger in area but with lower
    walls than Zimbabwe, closely rival the Great Zimbabwe in construction
    and boldness of design. But with regard to the more massive and highest
    portion of the main wall every practical builder who visits Zimbabwe
    is amazed at the equal distribution of the joints, the conscientious
    bonding of the outer courses, the good quality of stone selected, the
    careful dressing and the regularity of the sizes of the blocks, the
    neat packing throughout the whole width of the wall, and the tiling of
    the summits of the wall with “throughs.” The filling-in of the wall
    has been most conscientiously executed, and is seen to have been done
    course by course with the faces of the wall, as the courses throughout
    are pronounced to correspond with the outer courses of the wall on
    either side, and some builders have positively stated that some sort
    of a levelling instrument must have been used. “Straight joints” for
    more than two or three courses are absent, and these are rare, “false
    courses” are also rare, and there is little seen of chips levelling-up
    the corners of the blocks.</p>

  <p>The marvellous symmetry of the batter-back of the dry masonry,
    especially in the boldly conceived and most ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>cellently constructed
    sweep of the wall on its inner face from north to north-east and
    south-west, secures the admiration of every visitor, and forms one
    of the chief features by which the Great Zimbabwe stamps itself on
    one’s memory. The scrupulously careful workmanship displayed here, and
    particularly in the courses near the Chevron Pattern and on the outer
    face of the north-east portion of the wall, show undoubtedly the most
    superior of any ancient building yet discovered in Rhodesia, if not
    also of the important ruins lying at some distance, to the south-east,
    of which only sketch-plans and a few photographs are yet to hand. The
    massive solidity and excellent construction, together with its batter
    (see <cite>Architecture</cite>, section “Battering of Walls”), which this wall
    displays, have, no doubt, secured its wonderful preservation in spite
    of earthquake, effects of tree and creeper growth, and the ravages of
    some millenniums of time.</p>

  <p>The construction demonstrates the fact that the ancients in their own
    home in the north were thoroughly well-practised in the building with
    either stone blocks or bricks. Moreover, as suggested by Bent and
    Schlichter, the extensive use of granite cement in making floors both
    inside and outside the ruins at Zimbabwe proves that it was by design
    that the ancients adopted the system of building with dry masonry.</p>

  <p>Concerning the construction of the north-west and west portions of
    the main wall there has been much controversy, Bent and Schlichter
    being emphatic in stating that not only was it most inferior to that
    of the other portions of the main wall, but that it was obviously
    of later construction on contracted lines, but still ancient. These
    two archæologists could have arrived at this conclusion only by the
    measurement of the wall and by its quality of workmanship. Sir John
    Willoughby, on the other hand, contended that it is built as well as
    any other portion of the main wall. It is certainly not poor building
    that renders it less easy to climb along its summit, the difficulty
    being the number of loose stones which line the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>top owing to the
    summit having been threshed by branches of large trees.</p>

    <div class="caption">SOUTH-EAST WALL, WITH CHEVRON PATTERN, OF ELLIPTICAL TEMPLE, ZIMBABWE</div>
  </div>

  <p>This wall—now recently shown to be a reconstruction in a later ancient
    period<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>—is in every point better built than many walls on the
    Acropolis, and is superior in workmanship to many of the divisional
    walls of the Elliptical Temple. The outer face is fairly well
    constructed.</p>

  <h3>MEASUREMENTS OF MAIN WALL</h3>

  <p>The circumference of the outer face of the
    main wall taken at the level of the threshold of the entrances measures
    about 831 ft. As the foundations throughout the circumference are, as
    is shown later, some 3 ft. to 5 ft. below this level, and as the usual
    Zimbabwe batter-back prevails, the circumference of the foundations of
    this building may safely be estimated at a further 40 ft., which would
    make a total circumference of the base of the temple some 873 ft.</p>

  <p>The circumference of the inside face of the entire main wall measured
    at a corresponding level is about 776 ft. 6 in., the foundations, as
    shown later, being from 3 ft. to 5 ft. below the level at which this
    measurement was taken.</p>

  <p>Granite slabs with painted figures now mark the distances both outside
    and inside round the main wall, commencing in either case at the south
    side of the West Entrance and going south. The distances on the outside
    are marked at every 50 ft., and those on the inside at every 20 ft. A
    small black spot is painted on the wall just above each slab to denote
    the exact spot in each length measured.</p>

  <p>In this description of the Elliptical Temple all measurements in
    angular brackets are exterior measurements of the main wall only, and
    those in rounded brackets are those of interior measurements of the
    main wall, all commencing at the south side of the West Entrance and
    going south. For instance, “The North-West Entrance is situated between
    the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>following points in the main wall—[656 ft.] and [660 ft.] and (606
    ft. 6 in.) and (611 ft.),” or “A large granite beam lies at the base of
    the main wall at (338 ft.).”</p>

  <h3>SUMMIT OF MAIN WALL</h3>

  <p>For some fairly extensive lengths along the
    summit of the more massive portion of the main wall the blocks and
    stones are higher on the centre of the floor of the summit than at top
    outer edges on either side, from which edges the measurements of the
    heights above the exterior and interior surfaces of the ground were
    taken. Branches of trees beating in high winds upon the summit, the
    weight of heavy festoons of creepers hanging from the summit, and the
    growth of monkey-ropes and wild vines in the joints of the dry masonry
    have destroyed some of the upper courses on either side of the wall.
    Therefore to the heights stated in the foregoing tables should be
    added at least 1 ft. or 2 ft., this being a fair average height of the
    whale-back ridge along portions of the summit of the wall.</p>

  <p>An interesting question arises: What was the original height of the
    massive portion of the wall? There are some evidences that the original
    height could not have been more than six courses above the chevron
    pattern which runs on a true level on the upper and outer face of the
    wall between [189 ft.] and [455 ft.]. The greatest number of courses
    now remaining over this pattern is five, but these are only found at
    two points and for the length of a few blocks. At most points above
    the pattern there are no upper courses remaining; at other points one
    or two courses are perfect for some distance; the most frequent are
    three courses; while at several points there are four courses. To the
    heights given in the tables can safely be added 1 ft. to 2 ft. Were the
    obviously missing courses to be restored, the raised ridge along the
    centre of parts of the summit would be cleared, for these ridges of
    stones are formed of blocks once carefully packed, all on their flat
    sides, between side walls, and are similar to the existing internal
    portions of other well-built walls at Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p>Adding this further height of from 1 ft. to 2 ft. to the tabulated
    heights, we can carry the investigation much further. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span> upper faces
    of the blocks of the fourth and fifth courses above the pattern are too
    free from decomposition, weather-stain, and lichen to have formed the
    topmost courses; in fact, their upper surfaces are decidedly fresh,
    as if the courses above them had not long disappeared, and when it is
    recollected that experience shows that the exposed top surfaces of
    blocks are found to take on signs of decomposition and of exposure to
    weather, and also to become covered with lichen quicker than the side
    faces of blocks in the body of the wall, and that the upper courses
    would have given some evidences of long exposure, which they do not, we
    may be certain that the wall was carried a further course, or possibly
    two courses of the wall higher than the fifth course above the pattern.
    Therefore at many points along the highest portions of the wall, as
    shown in the tables, 2 ft. 6 in. may be added to the tabulated heights,
    and this would include the height of the six courses above the pattern
    throughout its whole length.</p>

  <p>Whether the original summit was higher than these six courses is a
    matter of conjecture. Possibly the wall was two or three courses higher
    than the six courses. Here, as elsewhere in the first-period ruins in
    Rhodesia, the best-built portion of the edifice is that which bears
    the decorative designs. This appears to be an invariable rule in such
    older ruins. But at this temple the whole wall, and especially the
    courses immediately above and below the pattern, are the best-built
    portions of the most superior wall of the building, the courses being
    far truer. Moreover, a good quality of stone is employed, giving the
    impression that it was specially selected for the purpose, so much so
    that their back parts are as well squared as their front faces. It is
    most obvious, as practical builders claim, that the pattern itself and
    its enclosing courses show the best workmanship on the part of the
    ancients, and this notwithstanding that this wall is admitted by all
    to stand pre-eminent among excellently constructed walls to be found
    anywhere in Rhodesia.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>

  <p>In removing the wall débris at the outer base of the wall containing
    the chevron pattern for the purpose of forming catchment areas for
    draining the ground near the wall, two classes of stone blocks were
    found, a quantity of large, shallow, flat stones similar to those lying
    in the middle parts of the summit of the walls, and also a quantity of
    well-shaped blocks as used both in the pattern and in the enclosing
    courses, but it was estimated that there were not enough of these
    blocks to have carried the outer face of the wall more than some two
    courses above the fifth course above the pattern. It is impossible to
    draw any corresponding inferences with regard to débris on the base of
    the interior side of the wall, for excavators have moved this out of
    all relative position to the wall from which it fell.</p>

  <p>But there is also some evidence as to the original height of the wall.
    Such of the undoubted monoliths as still stand more or less erect on
    the summit of the wall—and as is shown later, not every upright stone
    on this wall is necessarily a monolith—have no signs on their faces of
    having been built in by blocks up to any height above the level of the
    six courses above the pattern. In the case of any fallen monolith from
    the faces of which supporting blocks or any of them have disappeared,
    it can be ascertained to what depth the base of the monolith was built
    into the wall, and in this respect there is some evidence to guide one
    in estimating the original height of the ancient wall so adorned. The
    wearing of their sides by the edges of supporting blocks can almost
    always be noticed, in addition to which the rain of many centuries is
    guided to the base by the position of the supporting blocks which guide
    the water downwards, thus causing small rimlets to form on the lower
    part of the beams, especially those of slate or soapstone, where the
    rimlets have become in time beautifully smooth and glazed. Therefore
    it is highly probable that the height of the six courses above the
    pattern, with the present height of the wall above its foundations as
    given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span> in the tables, formed the original height of the massive portion
    of the enclosing wall.</p>

  <p>The discovery in December, 1902, of what are believed to be traces of a
    line of small round towers on the outer edge of the summit immediately
    over the chevron pattern—and these are referred to later—affords very
    strong evidence as to what was the original height of the wall, and
    points to the limit of six courses above the chevron pattern. The line
    of small round towers (recently found to have been conical) on the
    outer edge of the west wall of the Western Temple on the Acropolis have
    their foundations a few inches below the present summit of the wall.
    The foundations of the towers on the wall at the Elliptical Temple,
    now being described, have their foundations on the present surface of
    the central ridge along the summit of the wall, but were the pattern
    made good at the height of the six courses alone, the positions of
    these foundations would be identical in several respects with those of
    the towers on the Acropolis. Thus these foundations provide a fourth
    important corroborative clue as to the original height of the wall.</p>

  <p>Along the floor of the summit are laid some large, broad, but shallow
    slabs of granite of irregular form, while down below on either side
    were a score of others which have fallen off the wall. Bent suggested
    that the summit was once paved with these slabs. In view of the four
    proofs just adduced with regard to the original height of the wall
    being somewhat higher than is seen to-day, the purpose of the slabs
    could hardly be that of providing a pavement for the summit. Most
    probably they were the “ties” or “throughs” to bind the wall at its
    top courses, as invariably found near the summits of the best class of
    walls, especially so in all rounded ends of walls, summits of rounded
    buttresses, and in the Conical Tower where, near its summit, the back
    and inside ends of the blocks are frequently longer than in the lower
    courses where they are short. Many of these slabs on the main wall
    lie across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span> the wall on its present surface, but these are frequently
    covered with laid blocks. The best instances at Zimbabwe of the “tying”
    and bonding of the highest courses of walls are to be seen on the
    Acropolis, but this feature is elsewhere in Rhodesia common in several
    ruins which are not built upon the angular principle. It is natural to
    suppose that, if the ancients not only carefully tied the upper courses
    of almost all walls with “throughs,” and also tied several points
    between base and summit, this main wall bearing the decorative pattern,
    and once having on its summit, as is now believed, both round towers
    and soapstone beams, the ancients, admittedly being skilful builders,
    would regard the effective tying and bonding of such a wall as an
    important necessity, especially as the wide and commodious summit was,
    as stated by Bent, in all probability a look-out and much-frequented
    elevation. The stones which are uncovered are decomposed and lichen-
    and moss-covered on their upper faces, but are on their under side
    as fresh and as clean as if they had just been brought from the
    quarry. Some visitors, supposing these tie-stones to have been fallen
    monoliths, have placed four of them in an upright position where they
    now stand, but unlike all true monoliths, they are not weathered or
    time-eaten all round, and two so erected have all their faces perfectly
    clean and fresh.</p>

  <p>The summit of the north-west portion of the main wall is fairly level,
    save at north-west and west entrances where the wall is reduced in
    height, and also at several points where large branches of trees have
    beaten off the blocks of the upper courses. The narrow width of the
    summit, as shown in the foregoing tables, and the number of loose
    stones lying upon it, make it somewhat awkward for walking along it,
    still this can be done far more easily than might be supposed from Mr.
    Swan’s description. The battering-back of its outer and inner faces
    appears to point to its original summit being only slightly higher than
    its present top at its highest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span> point. If the wall were once more than
    three or four courses above its present highest point, the débris must
    have been removed, for no greater quantity of blocks were found than
    would have sufficed to make good that height.</p>

  <h3>FOUNDATION</h3>

  <p>For such massive walls it is astonishing to find that the
    bottom courses of the foundation are not more than from 2 ft. to 3 ft.
    6 in. below the present level of the ground immediately surrounding the
    building. The foundation has been examined at eighteen equi-distant
    points along the outer circumference, and in no single part does it
    rest on formation rock, the nearest proximity of which is at a further
    depth of 4 ft. on the north, 5 ft. on the west, 9 ft. on the south, and
    4 ft. on the east. Nor are the bottom courses formed of large blocks,
    as is so frequently seen in foundations of other ruins, but blocks
    no larger than those in the upper courses have been employed almost
    without exception. Near (177 ft.) there is a step-up in the foundation
    westwards of 5 ft. 9 in. Near [625 ft.] there runs for a few feet a
    very narrow step-back in the three lowest courses of the foundation,
    but this is the only point in the circumference of the wall where this
    feature can be noticed.</p>

  <p>The foundation bed upon which the wall is built is purely artificial.
    Evidently the ancient architects prepared a level surface for the wall,
    because there is only from 3 ft. to 5 ft. difference in the level of
    the foundations all round, notwithstanding that on the south-east the
    ground towards the “Valley of Ruins” and the temple which is erected on
    the edge of its slope commands the “Valley of Ruins.”</p>

  <p>The surface of the prepared foundation consisted of fine cement, now
    decomposed<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> to firm dry sand. This cement is in places at least 3
    ft. deep, is laid on the granite forma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>tion for 10 ft. and 15 ft.
    beyond the wall on both inside and outside the building, and later,
    when the lower courses of the foundation had been laid, a further
    flooring of cement was laid, making the side of the lower portion of
    the foundations at least 1 ft. 6 in., if not 2 ft. 6 in. deep.</p>

  <p>The enormous amount of time and labour required to be expended merely
    in preparing the surface on which to erect the temple is bewildering to
    contemplate, and fairly rivals as a demonstration of patient labour,
    length of time of construction, and good workmanship the massive walls
    themselves. The decomposed cement, which has now become mere sand, was
    very finely ground, there being not the smallest splinter of granite in
    its composition. The cement being yellow suggests that the ancients,
    to save breaking up large pieces of stone, were content to collect
    small fragments of granite which had become decomposed, and therefore
    were easier to grind, for everywhere in this locality, especially in
    damp places and near any granite boulder or glacis, are to be found
    quantities of small granite chips all yellow with decomposition.
    Possibly granite sand from neighbouring streams might also have been
    utilised.</p>

  <h3>CHEVRON PATTERN</h3>

  <p>On the upper portion of the exterior face of the south-east main
    wall is the celebrated chevron pattern which forms one of the most
    interesting features at the Elliptical Temple. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span> pattern runs
    for 265 ft. 6 in. from [189 ft.] to [456 ft. 6 in.] on the line of
    measurement of the exterior circumference of the temple, that is, from
    south-south-east to east-north-east.</p>

  <p>The pattern is in two rows or bands, which together are 18 in. deep,
    and Bent states that “it extends along the part of the wall which
    receives directly the rays of the sun when rising at the summer
    solstice.” The portion of the main wall carrying the pattern is in the
    form of an arc, and is the best-built and most substantial part of the
    wall. Granite monoliths still stand more or less erect on the summit
    of the wall above the pattern, but not elsewhere. Over the pattern
    are the foundations of what appear to have been small circular towers
    resembling in size and position those on the main west wall of the
    Western Temple on the Acropolis.</p>

  <p>In 1903 a quantity of sections of worked soapstone beams were found on
    the summit of the wall over the pattern. On no other portions of the
    summit are there traces of monoliths, round towers, or soapstone beams.
    Bent was unaware of the existence of the traces of round towers or of
    the soapstone beams on the wall over the pattern, yet he writes, as
    seems perfectly correct, “Those parts only of the wall which receive
    the direct rays of the sun when rising at the summer solstice are
    decorated by this symbolical pattern.” This statement equally applies
    to the Eastern Temple on the hill and to the large curved wall in
    Philips Ruins, also to the Western Temple, only in this latter case
    the great main wall, which is in the form of an arc and is decorated,
    receives on its face the rays of the setting sun at the winter
    solstice. A very strong corroboration of this statement is afforded by
    several other of the more important ruins in Rhodesia which are built
    upon the curved plan.</p>

  <p>In this pattern the blocks are placed on end with the top of each
    supported by the neighbouring block on one side, thus forming a series
    of triangular spaces with the bases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span> alternately up and down. The
    sides of these angular spaces are about 7 in. long, and the openings
    have been neatly filled in with small stones set back inside 2 in. or
    3 in. from flush with the face of the wall. The pattern is somewhat
    dilapidated in places owing to creeper growths on the wall and to the
    swinging of large tree branches, which in every wind beat the pattern
    and loosened the stones forming it.</p>

  <p>Chevron pattern was in ancient times the symbol for Fertility. It
    closely resembles the Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol for water, and also
    the zodiacal sign of Aquarius, and represents the sea on such Phœnician
    coins as have engravings of ships.</p>

  <p>This pattern is found on several of the ruins of the oldest type, and
    not on such as by their style of architecture may be considered to be
    of a later ancient period. It is found in several of the large ruins
    between Zimbabwe and the Sabi, also at Umnukwana Ruins. A portion of
    chevron of small size is to be seen at Dhlo-dhlo.</p>

  <h3>GROUND SURFACE OF EXTERIOR OF MAIN WALL</h3>

  <p>Till August, 1902, the area
    surrounding the Elliptical Temple was mere veld and bush, and trees and
    shrubs grew so thickly near the main wall that it was impossible at
    certain points to penetrate the jungle to make a complete examination
    of the wall, while piles of soil from excavations lay along the base
    of the wall, and some up against the wall itself, in some cases to a
    height of 6 ft. above the average level of the exterior ground.</p>

  <p>Trenches and deep holes, the main wall forming one side of them, were
    lined with mud, and filled with ferns and plants which could only
    flourish in a situation which was perpetually damp. There was every
    evidence that these trenches and holes were filled with water during
    each wet season, and that they retained a considerable amount of
    moisture even during the dry seasons. At two points this constant state
    of damp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span> held by these cuttings had caused the foundations, which at
    no place rest on the bed-rock, to sink some inches, thus imparting
    wave-like lines to the courses of the wall close to such holes.</p>

  <p>To remove this source of injury to the wall by causing it to sink and
    also by stimulating tree and creeper growths which were damaging the
    wall, it was decided to remove all such débris piles, and also the
    veld soil, most of which had in the course of ages silted down from
    the lower slopes of the Bentberg some 200 yds. distant on the south
    side of the temple, and to leave a floor of hard soil which would
    serve to drain off all rain-water and protect the bases of the walls
    from being washed by the storm streams from the higher ground. This
    work was carried out for a width of some 6 to 8 yds. round the entire
    circumference of the temple. Five catchment areas were formed on the
    north-west, west, south, and east sides, and from each such area a
    run-off now leads all rain-water into a hole sunk in the ground at some
    12 yds. distance from the main wall.</p>

  <p>These five holes, as shown later, have proved useful in demonstrating
    certain features connected with the temple which so far had been
    impossible of examination:—</p>

  <p>(1) The rock formation is at almost every point some feet below the
    lowest course of the foundations of the main wall, in most cases 3 ft.
    to 4 ft., and in one instance—the south—fully 6 ft.</p>

  <p>(2) The ground outside the temple has been raised by the silting of
    soil from the slopes of the Bentberg, by the spreading out of both
    ancient and old native débris piles, by the levelling up of the surface
    for laying clay floors of Makalanga huts, and by block débris from
    the main and several minor walls. This filling-in, both natural and
    artificial, averages to a height of at least 5 ft. above the level
    known to the ancients, thus reducing the comparative elevation of the
    temple to that extent. It is now clear that the temple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span> once stood on a
    comparatively higher and far more imposing elevation than it stands at
    present.</p>

  <p>(3) The granite plateau which underlies the soil upon which the temple
    is built is irregular, and resembles on a larger scale the granite
    plateaux which extend eastward from the temple.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

  <div class="subheadc">Main Entrances</div>

  <h3>NORTH-WEST ENTRANCE</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap">THIS entrance is on the north-west side of the temple at (606 ft. 6
    in.) to (611 ft. 6 in.) inside, and [656 ft.] to [660 ft.] outside. As
    in the case of <em>North and West Entrances</em>, the foundations of the main
    wall are carried from side to side of the entrance and from the floor
    of the passage, and in them the outer steps are built. The east side
    wall is 4 ft. wide where it starts to curve inwards to form the passage
    and at 6 ft. above the floor of the entrance. The west side is 7 ft.
    wide where it starts to round inwards and at 6 ft. above the entrance
    floor.</p>

  <p>Evidently this entrance was not of the importance of either of the
    other two portals to the temple. No internal passages converge upon it;
    it is less massive, and its purpose appears to have been limited to
    serving as a communication with <em>No. 1 Ruins</em> only, as a substantial
    wall which encloses these ruins runs round to the north-west main wall
    of the temple between [705 ft.] and [710 ft.], where it joins it at
    right angles to the main walls. These enclosing walls thus cut off on
    either side the exterior of the <em>North-West Entrance</em> from the other
    portions of the exterior of the temple, and in these enclosing walls no
    signs have so far been discovered of there having been any entrances.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This entrance is built on well-curved lines, but the rounded <span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>faces
    of the two side walls do not exactly face one another, since the
    outside face of the west side projects some 12 in. further north than
    that on the east side, the west wall being wider than the east one,
    though on their inside faces they are flush with each other. There are
    no buttresses on the outside of this entrance. The summits of the side
    walls, some 6 ft. above the outside level, are less ruined than those
    of the other two entrances; the gap between the two summits including
    the width of the entrance is only 8 ft. 6 in., the broken faces of the
    upper portions of the walls rising perpendicularly on either side.</p>

    <div class="caption">North-West Entrance<br />
      ELLIPTICAL TEMPLE<br />
      N<sup>o.</sup> 3 Enclosure</div>
  </div>

  <p>This entrance is 2 ft. 9 in. wide in the centre. The wall on the west
    side is perfect up to 5 ft. in height, and that on the east side to 6
    ft. 6 in. There are two steps on the outer side, and these are formed
    by the courses in the foundation being carried across the entrance and
    curved inwards at the centre of the passage.</p>

  <p>On either side of the entrance in the interior of the temple there are
    plumb and angular buttresses of poor construction resting upon soft
    soil. Each projects 5 ft. 6 in. into <em>No. 3 Enclosure</em>, and each is 1
    ft. 9 in. high, the width between their straight faces being 2 ft. 8
    in. Each buttress is rounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span> off on the outer side and joins the main
    wall, that on the east side being 7 ft. long, and that on the west side
    9 ft. 6 in. long.</p>

  <p>When Bent arrived at Zimbabwe in 1891 he found this entrance built
    up to a height of 9 ft. This had then been done some fifty years
    previously by the Makalanga when the previous Mogabe Chipfuno was
    only a boy. This walling-up was for the purpose of closing in <em>No. 3
    Enclosure</em>, which was used as a cattle kraal. It is highly probable
    that the Makalanga took the upper portions of the two buttresses which
    are on either side of the inside of this entrance for building material
    in so walling it up, for these buttresses, judging by the absence of
    stone débris and the condition of the faces of the main wall where
    the buttresses were once built up against it, appear to have been
    deliberately denuded of their courses for at least some feet of their
    original height.</p>

  <p>Bent removed the walling-up, but left its foundation in the entrance
    at 2 ft. below which the paved passage and steps were unburied in
    September, 1902. This foundation of the Makalanga wall was laid across
    a pile of blocks thrown promiscuously on to the floor of this entrance,
    and this again rested on soil black with charcoal, decomposed vegetable
    matter, and bones of buck split open for the marrow, and this débris
    contained broken articles of Makalanga make, but of superior quality to
    those made by them to-day.</p>

  <h3>THE NORTH ENTRANCE</h3>

  <p>This entrance is in the north-east wall of the temple, and its exit
    faces north-east, twenty-five degrees, and is situated between the (523
    ft. 6 in.) and (536 ft.) points of the measurement of the inside base
    of the main wall from the south side of the west entrance, and between
    the [566 ft. 6 in.] and [571 ft. 6 in.] points of the measurement of
    the outside base of the main wall from the south side of same entrance.
    It has always been known as the North Entrance, as it is on the north
    side of the centre of the temple. Bent terms it the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span> North Entrance, as
    do other writers, and in our description it will be so styled.</p>

  <p>Its massive size and excellent construction exceed those of any
    other known ancient entrance, unless it be the West Entrance, which,
    however, at present remains uncleared, and, except for the dilapidation
    of the higher portions of its rounded sides, it is certainly the
    best-preserved entrance so far discovered at Zimbabwe. Until November,
    1902, the existence of its symmetrical and massive steps was altogether
    unsuspected, for these and the outer face of the entrance had been
    buried to a depth of 5 ft. in débris, the major portion of which could
    not have been disturbed for apparently many scores of years. The
    opening out of this entrance and also of the walled-in area immediately
    in front and to the north<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span> of it has revealed another leading
    architectural feature in addition to those already known at this
    temple. Photographs of the North Entrance, as it previously appeared,
    now only represent the tops of the side walls of the entrance.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_219">
    <img src="images/i_219.jpg" width="458" height="550" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">North or Main Entrance<br />
      ELLIPTICAL TEMPLE<br />
      Zimbabwe</div>
  </div>

  <p>Though its outer side faces towards north-east, twenty-five degrees,
    the entrance passage itself runs somewhat obliquely through the wall,
    the south end being slightly more to the east than is the outer end,
    and standing in the middle of the south end the line of passage further
    to the north than does its outer face, and there is a view of the
    eastern end of the Acropolis, the lower portion of which is at present
    hidden by a pile of granite block débris removed from the interior of
    the temple.</p>

  <p>The main walls on either side of the entrance are exceedingly massive
    and exceptionally well built, the entrance and steps forming a
    handsome piece of dry masonry, which reveals the artistic plan and
    bold conception of the ancient architects, admirably executed by the
    builders. On the east side the wall is 15 ft. 6 in. wide at the points
    where the main wall starts to curve in forming the east side of the
    entrance, and this measurement is taken at 13 ft. above the level of
    the outside area. On the west side the main wall is 14 ft. 6 in. wide
    at the points where the wall starts to curve in forming the west side
    of this entrance, this measurement being taken at 12 ft. above the
    level of the outside area.</p>

  <p>The entrance passage is 15 ft. 9 in. long. It is 7 ft. 10 in. wide at
    the foot of the steps on the north side, and 12 ft. wide at the south
    end between those points on either side where the walls start to curve
    in forming the entrance. The steps occupy 4 ft. 4 in. of the north end
    of the length of the passage, and the rest is paved level; but at the
    south end the flooring is slightly uneven owing to roots having moved
    some of the paving blocks. The level at the south end terminates in a
    step-down, which runs from the south face of one side wall to the south
    face of the other side wall. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>The present heights of the reduced
    walls of the entrance are: east side, 7 ft. 6 in.; west side, 6 ft. 10
    in.</p>

    <div class="caption">EXTERIOR OF NORTH ENTRANCE TO ELLIPTICAL TEMPLE</div>
    <div class="subcaption">(DISCOVERED 1903)</div>
  </div>

  <p>There are six rows of steps each 7 in. high, and each row in its centre
    recedes 10 in. beyond the one below it, the row curving inwards at its
    centre. The walls on either side of this entrance are not separate
    walls, but a common foundation runs under both, forming the floor of
    the passage, which floor is 3 ft. 4 in. higher than the level of the
    outer area.</p>

  <p>The steps are formed by the courses of blocks of the outer face of the
    wall on one side passing to the outer face of the wall on the opposite
    side, where they are continued, making a curve inwards, each curve
    receding with mathematical precision behind the curve in front. The
    courses on either side assume a fan-like form, thus making the curved
    courses of the steps wider in the middle than on the sides. The steps
    were built before the side walls of the passage were erected, and their
    marvellous regularity demonstrates the foresight of the builders. The
    end blocks of each row are partly built into the walls on either side.
    The courses in the main wall at this point are remarkably even and
    correct, the courses on the one side corresponding with the courses on
    the other. These steps are identical in measurement with all steps, so
    far discovered, found built in any ancient wall of the oldest type of
    ruin, and are of altogether different construction from those of the
    angular and terraced ruins of the later period in which the angular
    side walls of an entrance are first erected, and the steps afterwards
    built in between them.</p>

  <p>Bent frequently refers to this entrance as the main entrance of the
    temple. In so doing he is in all probability correct, though many of
    the facts concerning it, which give it an importance not possessed by
    either of the other two entrances, were then unknown to him. These were
    discovered in November, 1902. But the fact that three passages—Parallel
    Passage, Inner Parallel Passage, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span> South Passage—all converge
    on this entrance shows that it must have possessed considerable
    importance. But the recent clearing away of the débris to a depth of
    some 6 ft. has revealed the lower portion of the entrance with its
    well-constructed flight of steps, as well as the admirably proportioned
    structure of the entrance, which can now be seen to be by far the
    finest entrance to the temple.</p>

  <p>But the further discovery in November, 1902, of the long-buried
    North-East Passage, and the clearing out of the Outer Parallel Passage,
    both of which converge on the outer face of this entrance, have
    disclosed the fact that an even greater importance attached to this
    entrance than Bent or Sir John Willoughby could have supposed, for the
    existence of the North-East Passage was unknown to them, seeing that
    the summits of its side walls were buried at least 2 ft. under the
    veld. This passage, with buried enclosures on either hand, has now been
    cleared out for 108 yds., with traces of an extension for a further
    70 yds. in a direct line towards the south-east Ancient Ascent to the
    Acropolis, and as the large area, known as the “Valley of Ruins,” lies
    along this route, and is connected with the passage by numerous side
    passages and openings, the importance of the North Entrance is very
    considerably enhanced, and Bent’s conjecture is shown to be fully
    confirmed.</p>

  <h3>WESTERN ENTRANCE</h3>

  <p>This is the second largest entrance to the temple, and would appear
    to have been of some importance. It is by the <em>West Entrance</em> that
    visitors now usually enter the building. The gateway opens directly
    into <em>No. 5 Enclosure</em>.</p>

  <p>The entrance is situated between [827 ft. 9 in.] and [831 ft. 9 in.] on
    the line of the measurement of the circumference of the exterior of the
    building, which starts on the south side of the entrance, and between
    (763 ft. 6 in.) and (766 ft. 6 in.) on the line of the measurement
    of the circumference of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>interior of the main wall, which also
    starts on the south side of this entrance. (See <em>Main Wall</em>.)</p>

    <div class="caption">WEST ENTRANCE FROM INTERIOR, ELLIPTICAL TEMPLE</div>
  </div>

  <p>The south side is formed by the boldly rounded end of the main
    wall, which is here reduced in height to 7 ft. 6 in., or including
    foundations to 11 ft. The reduced summit is 6 ft. 6 in. wide, and has
    a batter of 8 in. At 10 ft. from the side wall the main wall rises
    abruptly from 7 ft. to 22 ft.</p>

  <p>The north side is formed by the main wall, which has a rounded end. Its
    height is 8 ft., but rises sharply to 20 ft. The reduced summit is 6
    ft. wide, and there is a batter of 10 in. on the face of the side wall.</p>

  <p>The passage-way is 4 ft. 2 in. wide between the rounded ends of the two
    walls, and it has a total length of 20 ft. 6 in., 9 ft. 6 in. being
    over the foundation and 11 ft. over the semi-circular platform, which
    supports the two rounded buttresses on the inner side of the entrance.
    Unlike the <em>Main Entrance</em> this passage passes through the wall at
    right angles.</p>

  <p>The semi-circular platform projects into <em>No. 5 Enclosure</em> for 11 ft.,
    and upon it, and on either side of the entrance, are two buttresses,
    that on the south side being 9 ft. high and 10 ft. wide at the back;
    the one on the south side being very much dilapidated is now only 6 ft.
    high on the north side and 6 ft. wide at back. These buttresses and the
    platform are one structure, the courses in the buttresses are carried
    across the passage in a semi-circular form, thus forming steps.</p>

  <p>The problem as to the entrance having ever been covered over is at
    present an open one, and there is much to be said on either side. The
    old men of the Amangwa state that it once had wooden beams across, and
    that the entrance was blocked up with stones. The <em>North-West Entrance</em>
    was in 1891 found by Bent, who reopened it, to have also been built
    up at a very late date, and so completely blocked. (See <cite>Entrances</cite>,
    Chapter VII.)</p>

  <p>On the exterior, and on either side of the entrance, stood, till 1903,
    very large débris heaps, each of which was at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span> 8 ft. high and
    many yards in circumference. These on being removed were found to
    represent several distinct occupations of the temple, and two-thirds of
    their height was accounted for by native occupations and the removal
    by explorers of débris from the interior of the building. The native
    portion contained ashes and bones in large quantities, iron assegai
    heads, hoes, brass and iron wire bangles, clay whorls, and ordinary
    native pottery. Some few small relics were found in the soil which
    had been taken from the temple. In the lowest portion, which was not
    thicker than 18 in., were found phalli, splinters of soapstone beams,
    excellent pottery, gold crucibles, beaten gold and gold wire. There
    were several layers of ashes, but very few animal bones. The two heaps
    had been piled up against the main wall.</p>

  <h3>NO. 1 ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap">THIS enclosure is on the north side of the temple, the outer face of
    its north-eastern wall being 18 ft. south-west of the <em>North Entrance</em>.
    This is the most perfect of all the enclosures. It is roughly circular,
    and there are no angular features in the body of the wall, though both
    entrances have their outer corners squared. The area is: north to south
    56 ft. 6 in., and east to west 55 ft. 6 in.</p>

  <p>The average height of the walls all round the enclosure is 7 ft. above
    the present surface of the filled-in area. At the north-east end the
    summit of the wall is 11 ft. above the bottom of an old hole excavated
    at that point, and in the hole the foundation is exposed. On the
    north-west side the summit of the wall is 9 ft. above the red cemented
    floor of an old Makalanga hut which had solid clay sides.</p>

  <p>The walls are very substantial, being 5 ft. 6 in. wide and 4 ft. and 5
    ft. above the surface of the area, as it was before clearing operations
    were commenced.</p>

  <p>There are two entrances, one on the north side and the other on the
    east side.</p>

  <p>The north entrance leads from <em>No. 3 Enclosure</em>, and is 2 ft. 6 in.
    wide, and its walls are rounded on the inside and angular on the
    outside, the side walls being between 3 ft. and 4 ft. high. There are
    four rows of steps, somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span> rudely constructed, each being about 10
    in. from front to back. A small parapet wall carries the steps from the
    lower level of <em>No. 3 Enclosure</em>.</p>

  <p>The walls of the east entrance are rounded on the inside and angular
    on the outside. The entrance is 2 ft. wide, 5 ft. long, with a level
    floor for this length, the foundation being carried across the opening,
    and the walls on either side are 4 ft. high. There is one step inside
    at the end of the 5-ft. length, and one step outside from the floor of
    <em>South Passage</em>. There are no portcullis grooves to this entrance. On
    the inside of this entrance is a stone platform which might once have
    carried buttresses.</p>

  <p>This enclosure has been subjected to the filling-in process more than
    any other enclosure of the temple, probably because of its proximity
    to the <em>North-West Entrance</em> through which the material could easily
    have been brought in from outside. On the present surface there are
    remains of an old Makalanga hut, which must be more than sixty years
    old, seeing that the Makalanga have not resided in the temple for over
    that period. At a depth of from 1 ft. 6 in. to 2 ft. below this surface
    the remains of a still very much older Makalanga hut have been exposed.
    This was constructed of red clay, beautifully polished, the flooring
    being on a very true level. This class of old huts had their clay
    sides altogether independent of the roof, which was supported by poles
    inserted at a distance of some inches from the outside of the walls.
    (See <cite>Architecture</cite>—<cite>Makalanga Huts</cite>.)</p>

  <p>The only “finds” made here were fragments of large soapstone bowls
    carved with herring-bone and cord patterns, small clay animals, assegai
    heads, and pottery of old, but not ancient, design or make, and
    comparatively recent native pottery.</p>

  <p>A drain passes through the west wall of this enclosure, and has a fall
    into <em>No. 3 Enclosure</em>.</p>

  <p>Bent stated that this enclosure was not a portion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span> original
    building. There are indications that this conjecture is correct. The
    walls are built without any regularity in courses and of stones of all
    shapes and sizes, the west wall crossing over the foundations of an
    older wall.</p>

  <h3>NO. 2 ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>This is a pear-shaped enclosure at the north-north-west side of the
    temple, and is built up immediately against the main outer wall from
    (530 ft.) to (578 ft.), and is on the west side of the <em>North Entrance</em>.</p>

  <p>It is 47 ft. long from south-east to north-east, and 13 ft. wide from
    north-east to south-west at its broadest part.</p>

  <p>From (560 ft.) to (565 ft.) the main wall is considerably broken,
    having fallen outwards. It is between these points that there is a
    narrow break in the foundations, which supports the view regarding the
    reconstruction of the western wall at a later ancient period, a matter
    dealt with in the description of the main wall, and in the Preface.</p>

  <p>This enclosure has only one entrance, and this is at the south-east
    end. It has rounded walls, is 8 ft. long, 2 ft. 2 in. wide, and the
    wall on the south-west is 4 ft. high, and that on the north-east side 7
    ft. high. The floor of this enclosure is between 2 ft. and 3 ft. below
    the floor of the adjoining <em>North Entrance</em>, and there is one stone and
    one cement step in the entrance passage of this enclosure.</p>

  <p>A substantial wall, 4 ft. to 8 ft. high, and 4 ft. wide at 4 ft. from
    the ground, but evidently of later construction, is on the south side,
    and separates this enclosure from <em>No. 3 Enclosure</em>, but it has a deep
    depression on its summit, and is very considerably ruined for about 20
    ft.</p>

  <p>There is a drain-hole through the main wall at (545 ft.).</p>

  <p>This enclosure has suffered very considerably at the hands of
    unauthorised searchers for ancient gold relics, some of the flooring
    having been torn up, and the foundations of part of the southern wall
    have been undermined.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>

  <p>Here in a débris heap was found the large plain flat-rimmed soapstone
    bowl which was lent by the late Rt. Hon. C. J. Rhodes to the South
    African Museum at Cape Town.</p>

  <h3>NO. 3 ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>This is the most north-westerly enclosure of the temple, the north-west
    main wall from (590 ft.) to (660 ft.) forming its north-westerly
    boundary. The south side is formed by <em>No. 1 Enclosure</em>, the west by
    <em>No. 4 Enclosure</em>, and the north and east by <em>No. 2 Enclosure</em>.</p>

  <p>The area is keystone-shaped, being 76 ft. long on its north-west side,
    45 ft. 6 in. on its west side, 71 ft. on the south side, and 50 ft. 6
    in. on the north and east side.</p>

  <p>The <em>North-West Entrance</em> to the temple is at (606 ft. 6 in.) to (611
    ft. 6 in.) on the north-west side of the enclosure. (See <em>Main Wall,
    North-West Entrance</em>, for description.)</p>

  <p>The entrance in the west wall between <em>Nos. 3 and 4 Enclosures</em> was not
    at the present gap in the débris of this wall, as the gap was made for
    the convenience of visitors. The foundations of this wall end abruptly
    at 25 ft. from its east end, this portion of the wall being in a fairly
    good condition for 14 ft., and being from 3 ft. to 6 ft. high.</p>

  <p>The entrance to <em>No. 1 Enclosure</em> is in the south wall at 45 ft. to 49
    ft. from the west wall.</p>

  <p>The east entrance has rounded sides, is 2 ft. wide, and the side walls
    are 4 ft. high. This entrance leads from <em>South Passage</em>, and is
    immediately inside the <em>North Entrance</em> to the temple.</p>

  <p>A drain from <em>No. 1 Enclosure</em> is in the angle formed by the west and
    south walls.</p>

  <p>Possibly this enclosure was once subdivided, but when mediæval and even
    later Makalanga occupied the temple for their residence and cattle
    kraal the sub-divisional walls were removed. That this portion of
    the temple was used for this purpose is demonstrated both by “finds”
    and the condi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>tion of the enclosure, and these support the native
    assertion to this effect. The remains of a wall runs north-west from
    the south-west corner of the enclosure towards the west side of the
    <em>North-West Entrance</em>. This is 16 ft. long, 2 ft. high, and 3 ft. 6 in.
    wide. A second wall is believed to have once stood between the west
    side of the entrance to <em>No. 1 Enclosure</em> and the north and east side
    wall.</p>

    <div class="caption">Nos. 3 &amp; 4 ENCLOSURES AND WEST MAIN WALL, ELLIPTICAL TEMPLE</div>
  </div>

  <p>At (640 ft.) is a long granite slab, which has evidently fallen from
    the summit of the main wall. Probably it was a tie or “through” stone,
    as the summit of the main wall had been bonded with similar stones.</p>

  <p>In the angle formed by the north-east and north-west walls are
    the remains of a large rounded buttress now only 2 ft. high.
    Possibly this might be one of the platforms with “blind steps” (see
    <cite>Architecture</cite>—<cite>Blind Steps</cite>) which are found in the angles in several
    of the temple enclosures.</p>

  <p>This enclosure appears to have been filled in with stones and earth at
    a very late period, as the filling-in contains at all depths portions
    of Makalanga pottery and lumps of iron slag. The ancient floor is
    believed to be some 2 ft. below the present surface.</p>

  <h3>NO. 4 ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>This is the most westerly of the temple enclosures. Its form resembles
    that of a keystone with the broad side on the west main wall, along the
    inside of which it extends for 67 ft. from (666 ft.) to (730 ft.)</p>

  <p>It is bounded on the north side by the divisional wall separating
    it from <em>No. 3 Enclosure</em>, and this side is 47 ft. 6 in. long. This
    wall extends from the outer face of the west portion of the wall of
    <em>No. 1 Enclosure</em> for 14 ft., from which it is in a good state of
    preservation, except for reduction in height, it being now only between
    4 ft. and 6 ft., while the rest of the wall is ruined, and is lost in a
    line of débris which marks where the wall once stood. At the west end
    of this débris are a few blocks still retaining their position, and
    these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span> show where the north wall joined the main wall. As on the north
    side of this wall, where there is now no trace of entrance between
    <em>Nos. 2 and 3 Enclosures</em>, so is it on its south side, where the face
    of the wall is even more ruined than on the opposite side.</p>

  <p>On the south side this enclosure is bounded by the divisional wall
    between it and <em>No. 5 Enclosure</em>. This wall is 58 ft. long, and bends
    southwards in the middle of its length for 5 ft. from a line between
    the two extremities of the wall. At the east end of the wall it is 6
    ft. high for 5 ft. in length, when it is reduced to 2 ft. with débris
    3 ft. higher lying along the summit. The west end of the wall is very
    poorly built, and as this enclosure has also been used by the Makalanga
    as a cattle kraal, probably finding the wall broken down at its
    western end, they rebuilt it in order to keep in the cattle. The wall
    throughout is built on a raised cement foundation only slightly wider
    than the wall itself.</p>

  <p>Though there is at present no trace of any entrance between this and
    <em>No. 5 Enclosure</em>, there are reasons for believing that traces of one
    may be discovered near the spot where a large fig tree grows on the
    line of wall.</p>

  <p>The east side is 33 ft. in length, and is formed for 10 ft. from the
    north side by the west outer face of the wall of <em>No. 1 Enclosure</em>,
    which is here 11 ft. high; for the following 12 ft. by the opening into
    the <em>West Passage</em> which runs parallel to the south-west and west sides
    of <em>No. 1 Enclosure</em>; and for 13 ft. by the outer and west face of the
    <em>West Passage</em>, the wall of which is 10 ft. high, and is well built,
    substantial, and in a good state of preservation.</p>

  <p>The whole of the interior of this enclosure has been deliberately
    and rudely filled in with soil, débris, also with stones which have
    fallen into it, and for almost 2 ft. in depth it is covered with rich
    vegetable mould. [This latter was removed in 1903.]</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

  <h3>NO. 5 ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>This enclosure is immediately inside the <em>West Entrance</em> to the temple,
    the western and south-western main wall forming its boundary on those
    sides from (735 ft.) to (760 ft.) on the north side of the entrance,
    and from (0 ft.) to (100 ft.) on the south side of the entrance, thus
    making its length on the side of the main wall to be 130 ft.</p>

  <p>The area was once subdivided, but at present it is difficult to say
    exactly where the sub-divisional walls ran, though the faint traces of
    these are to be seen in several directions, but all appear to radiate
    from the eastern side of the enclosure towards the inside face of the
    main wall.</p>

  <p>The north side is 59 ft. long, the south wall of <em>No. 4 Enclosure</em>
    being its northern boundary. The face of this wall at its eastern
    extremity is well built, but the western portion of it is very poorly
    constructed. The probable cause of this difference in the building of
    the wall was explained in the description of <em>No. 4 Enclosure</em>, and
    also in the Preface.</p>

  <p>The eastern side for 36 ft. in length from the north side is formed
    by a very well-built wall which forms the southern extremity of <em>West
    Passage</em>. This wall is now only 6 ft. in height, but the great amount
    of wall-débris lying at its bases suggests that it was once some 7
    ft. higher. It is 6 ft. wide on its present summit. From this point
    to the southern end of the enclosure the rest of the eastern side is
    open space, with traces of substantial wall foundations all along this
    length. The total length of the eastern side of this enclosure is 93 ft.</p>

  <p>The south side, which is 37 ft. long, is formed by faint traces of a
    wall which divides this area from <em>No. 6 Enclosure</em>, extending from the
    west outer side of <em>No. 7 Enclosure</em> to the main wall.</p>

  <p>The width at the centre of this enclosure from east to west is 57 ft.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

  <p>A flat granite monolith stands at 30 ft. north-east of the north
    buttress of the <em>West Entrance</em> with a flat face towards the west. It
    rises from the ground 6 ft. 9 in., is 3 ft. broad, narrowing to 1 ft.
    10 in. at the top. It is 3 in. thick, and leans slightly towards the
    east. No artificial markings can be discovered on either of its faces.</p>

  <p>A triangular-shaped granite beam stands 2 ft. 11 in. above the ground
    at 26 ft. north-east of the south buttress of the <em>West Entrance</em>. A
    fractured portion of the beam, until lately buried, lies near. This
    section is 8 ft. 2 in. long. Twelve years ago this beam was complete.
    It then had a tilt towards the north, and its base must be deep to have
    supported its heavy weight in a leaning position.</p>

  <p>Other sections of fractured granite monoliths were buried at this
    spot; one set of sections exceed together 8 ft., without taking into
    consideration a section which is missing.</p>

  <p>The latest floor of this enclosure is at least 2 ft. below the present
    surface, the soil on the top being vegetable mould thickly matted with
    roots of wild vines and other creepers. [In August, 1903, this top soil
    was removed from the whole area. Several pieces of beaten gold and some
    Arabian glass were found lying on the hard soil underneath it.]</p>

  <h3>NO. 6 ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>This adjoins <em>No. 5 Enclosure</em>, which forms its western boundary. The
    south side is formed by the south main wall of the temple from (100
    ft.) to (179 ft. 3 in.). The north and north-east side is formed by
    the south wall of <em>No. 7 Enclosure</em>. This wall is from 5 ft. to 11
    ft. high. The eastern side is formed by the west wall of the <em>Sacred
    Enclosure</em>, which is from 8 ft. to 11 ft. high.</p>

  <p>The measurements of this area are: south side, 79 ft.; north side, 58
    ft.; east side, 22 ft.; and west side, 31 ft.</p>

  <p>This enclosure has two entrances. Probably another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span> entrance may be
    discovered on the western side on the removal of débris.</p>

  <p>The northern entrance is at 35 ft. to 37 ft., measuring from the
    eastern end of the north wall. This leads into <em>No. 7 Enclosure</em>. It
    has rounded walls, and the floor forms part of the foundation. There
    are no portcullis grooves.</p>

  <p>The eastern entrance is at 13 ft. to 15 ft., measuring from the north
    end of the east wall. This leads into the <em>Sacred Enclosure</em>. Its walls
    are rounded, and there are portcullis grooves. The steps are built into
    the wall. On either side of the entrance there are traces of rounded
    buttresses.</p>

  <p>Monkey-rope roots have done serious injury to the eastern end of the
    north wall, and have caused a depression of 5 ft. from the average
    height of the reduced wall.</p>

  <p>This enclosure is interesting because it showed three floors below the
    soil surface. On removing the mould which form the top surface for a
    depth of 1 ft. to 2 ft., was found the common red clay foundation of
    a Makalanga hut, about which lay iron hoes, assegai-heads, and also
    pottery of no great age. Below this, for a further depth of 1 ft. to 1
    ft. 6 in., was a promiscuous filling-in of blocks and soil, and below
    this again was a very hard soil, probably of decomposed cement, and on
    this hard surface was a pile of about 20 lbs. weight of portions of
    pottery scorifiers and small crucibles, all of which showed gold richly
    on the flux. These had evidently been piled up as rubbish, for they
    were all found within an area of 2 sq. ft., and no other portions of
    scorifiers or crucibles were found elsewhere in this enclosure. A pair
    of iron pincers made of two pieces of iron welded together at one end,
    an iron gong, and a soapstone amulet were discovered together, while
    on the lowest floor was a portion of a large soapstone bowl carved
    with herring-bone on cord pattern, and the fractured bases of what are
    believed to be true phalli. This lowest floor is 9 in. deeper than the
    one on which the gold crucibles were found, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span> is made of whitish
    cement, and has been exposed for about 4 sq. ft. in the north-east
    corner of the enclosure at 11 ft. below the summit of the east wall.</p>

  <p>The reconstruction of the north wall at its eastern end is very
    conspicuous. This reconstruction is referred to in the description of
    <em>No. 7 Enclosure</em>.</p>

  <p>In the soil débris pile, which had been removed from <em>No. 7 Enclosure</em>
    into this enclosure in 1891 by Bent, was (in August, 1902) found a
    piece of glass, being the lip portion of a bowl. This had bosses on its
    surface, with gold rims round each boss, indicating that the upper part
    of the neck of this bowl was once covered with gold enamel. This glass
    is believed to be identical with that found by Sir John Willoughby,
    and pronounced by authorities at the British Museum to belong to the
    thirteenth century.</p>

  <h3>NO. 7 ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>This enclosure is on the south side of the temple, the south and
    south-west wall running for 55 ft. parallel with the main wall at a
    distance of about 21 ft. This enclosure, next to <em>No. 1 Enclosure</em>, is
    in the best state of preservation of any chamber within the temple.
    Its area is 54 ft. 6 in. from north to south, and 39 ft. from east
    to west, and its form resembles a quarter section of a circle, with
    its rounded side extending from south-west to north, the centre of
    which quarter-circle is at the south-south-east end of the area. The
    present surface of the area is very uneven, owing to the operations of
    excavators and searchers for relics.</p>

  <p>There are two entrances still more or less intact, one on the
    south-west side leading into <em>No. 6 Enclosure</em>, and the other at the
    north corner, but facing west. Possibly there was also an entrance on
    the east side, where a gigantic fig tree, 50 ft. high, now stands.</p>

  <p>The south-west entrance (see section) is protected on the inside by
    rounded buttresses on either side, which project <span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>2 ft. 6 in. into
    the enclosure. These buttresses, of which only the lower courses now
    remain, are built upon, and at each end of, a semi-circular base 11 ft.
    long protruding 4 ft. 6 in. into the enclosure, the face courses of
    which curve inwards, one above and behind, the other between the side
    buttresses, and so form steps up to the entrance, the courses above
    the steps being carried round the buttresses. There are no traces of
    portcullis grooves. This is a form of steps found in the entrances
    through the main wall of the temple, and in the entrances in many
    ruins of the oldest or first-period style of architecture, whether at
    Zimbabwe or elsewhere in the country.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The north entrance is of exactly similar construction, but is in a
    better state of preservation, the one buttress remaining being still 5
    ft. high. This entrance has portcullis grooves.</p>

  <p>The best-built portion of the walls of this enclosure is undoubtedly
    that of the curved wall which extends from south-west to north. This is
    a fine piece of work, and the face of the wall is very regular. This
    wall is from 11 ft. to 13 ft. high on the inside, and 11 ft. to 14 ft.
    high on the outside, and is 4 ft. 6 in. wide in its present summit, the
    line of which is even except at its extremities. Judging by the block
    débris, this wall might once have been fully 2 ft. to 3 ft. higher.
    The centre of the outward curve of the wall is 11 ft. west from a line
    drawn between the extreme points of the curve.</p>

  <p>The south wall may be divided into two sections, the westerly portion
    being well built, and the easterly portion very poorly constructed,
    having numerous straight joints, disappearing and false courses, and is
    built of stones of all sizes and shapes. This latter part is evidently
    a reconstruction at a later date and on the old foundations. Where the
    joint was made between the old and the later walls is very clearly
    discernible, while there is a deep depression in the summit of the wall
    at this point. These depressions almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span> always exist in joints between
    old and later walls. This wall is 32 ft. long, between 8 ft. and 9 ft.
    high, and is 4 ft. wide on its reduced summit.</p>

  <p>The eastern side is in four lengths: (1) a small portion of wall in
    the south-east corner 6 ft. long, 6 ft. high, and 4 ft. wide; (2) a
    gap of 14 ft., evidently made by past and present trees; (3) a wall 7
    ft. high, 13 ft. long, and 3 ft. wide on its summit (the lower portion
    of this section is built up against (4), but in the upper section it
    is built into it); and (4) a wall 16 ft. long, 9 ft. high, 4 ft. wide
    on summit. This wall has been partly ruined at its western end by the
    roots of a large tree.</p>

  <p>The connection between sections (3) and (4) where the lower portion
    of (3) is built up against and is independent of (4), while the
    upper portion of (3) is built and bonded into and forms part of (4),
    has an exact parallel in the west wall of <em>Recess Enclosure</em> on the
    <em>Acropolis</em>, where the lower portions of two walls are independent of
    each other, but their higher portions are bonded and built as one wall.</p>

  <p>In August, 1902, some thirty tons of explorers’ débris of old date
    were removed from this enclosure, and a floor of granite cement was
    disclosed at its south end, in the middle of which, and forming part of
    the cement work, is a raised circular platform 7 in. high, 16 ft. 10
    in. in circumference, and with rounded sides. Close to it was found a
    rounded piece of diorite extensively marked with hammerings, as if it
    had been used for an anvil.</p>

  <p>Along the base of the south wall is a cemented edging 6 in. high, 17
    ft. long, with rounded edges, protruding 8 in. to 12 in. from the wall.
    In the south corner are two blind steps made of granite cement (see
    <cite>Architecture</cite>—<cite>Blind Steps</cite>).</p>

  <div class="subheadc">Sacred Enclosure—Conical Tower—Small Tower—Parallel Passage.</div>

  <h3>NO. 8<br />THE SACRED ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap">THIS enclosure, which contains the <em>Conical Tower</em> and the now ruined
    “<em>Little Cone</em>,” lies on the south-east of the temple area, the main
    east wall from south-east to east-north-east being its eastern boundary
    from (186 ft.) to (315 ft).</p>

  <p>In shape it is long and narrow, the <em>Conical Tower</em> practically
    dividing the area into two almost equal sections: <em>Sacred Enclosure</em>
    (<em>east</em>), and <em>Sacred Enclosure</em> (<em>west</em>).</p>

  <p>The length of this enclosure measured along the inside face of the main
    wall is 129 ft. 2 in. The northern side is formed by sections of walls
    which in the main run parallel with the south wall of the temple. The
    northern sections of walls are at the following distances from the main
    wall: at the extreme west 25 ft.; at (186 ft.) 31 ft.; on either side
    of the <em>Conical Tower</em> 26 ft.; at (300 ft.) 17 ft.; and at the extreme
    east 5 ft, this last portion for 13 ft. being greatly narrowed by large
    buttresses on either side up to the entrance of the <em>Parallel Passage</em>.</p>

  <p>The northern wall sections commencing at the west end are as follows:—</p>

  <p>A wall 28 ft. long forming the south wall of <em>No. 11 Enclosure</em>. The
    first section of 20 ft. is indifferently built, but the last 8 ft. well
    constructed. The joint between the two classes of walls is obvious,
    and the inferior wall is considerably dilapi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>dated at its western end,
    especially at the western entrance. The highest portion is 9 ft. 6 in.
    above the present surface of the interior.</p>

  <p>The second section is the south wall of <em>The Platform</em>, which rounds
    on a length of 24 ft. into <em>Sacred Enclosure</em> (<em>west</em>) for 7 ft., and
    recedes again directly north of the <em>Conical Tower</em>. This rounded wall
    is exceedingly well built. Its summit is practically level, and its
    height is 11 ft. to 14 ft., according to the rise and fall of the floor
    or steps of the enclosure.</p>

  <p>The third section is a wall 48 ft. long, extending from north of the
    <em>Conical Tower</em> to the entrance of the <em>Parallel Passage</em>. From the
    south side of this wall, and just inside the north entrance, is a
    wall 13 ft. high, 5 ft. wide, narrowing as the <em>Conical Tower</em> is
    approached, projecting towards the north-east side of the <em>Conical
    Tower</em>. The last 27 ft. of this third section is evidently of a later
    period construction. The joint of the older and later walls is very
    clearly defined, and there is a depression on the summit at this point.
    The height of the wall varies from 14 ft. to 16 ft.</p>

  <p>The <em>Sacred Enclosure</em> has four entrances—south-west, west, north, and
    east.</p>

  <p>The south-west entrance is from <em>No. 6 Enclosure</em>. This has rounded
    walls and portcullis grooves, and is 5 ft. high on either side, 2 ft.
    wide, and runs through a wall 4 ft. 10 in. thick. On the inside of
    this entrance are the remains of steps which relic prospectors have
    destroyed. The floor of the entrance is 4 ft. above the floor of the
    enclosure.</p>

  <p>The western entrance, which leads from <em>No. 9 Enclosure</em>, is also
    rounded, and had portcullis grooves, and its floor was once paved with
    cement. This entrance is in a very dilapidated condition, owing to
    trees and creepers.</p>

  <p>The north or main entrance to this enclosure is rounded on either side,
    and has portcullis grooves. It is 2 ft. 10 in. wide, and is directly
    north of the <em>Conical Tower</em>, between <span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>which and this entrance the
    floor is substantially paved with cement, and has cement steps leading
    down into the enclosure on the west side of the <em>Conical Tower</em>.</p>

    <div class="caption">THE SMALL CONICAL TOWER, ELLIPTICAL TEMPLE</div>
  </div>

  <p>The east entrance leads from the <em>Parallel Passage</em>, and measurements
    of it are given in the description of that passage.</p>

  <p>The buttresses on either side of the inner side of the eastern entrance
    have not the appearance of being ancient, unless they had once
    collapsed and been roughly rebuilt at a much later period.</p>

  <p>The eastern section of this enclosure has been cleared of débris down
    to the level of a yellow granite cement floor. In several places this
    flooring has been destroyed by roots of both past and present trees of
    great size. This section appears to have had to absorb all rainfall
    from the south-east area of the temple, as this enclosure is at a much
    lower level than the adjoining enclosures, and this may account for
    the decomposition at some points of the cement floor. The clearing to
    the cement floor has also been carried round the base of the <em>Conical
    Tower</em>, which now stands upon an almost level floor. The spot where
    Bent sank the hole through the cement can plainly be seen on the south
    side of the tower. The clearing also disclosed a granite cement step
    at the north entrance with a level cement floor on the inner side
    between it and the north side of the tower. This floor is 2 ft. above
    the cement floor round the base of the tower, from which raised floor
    two granite steps between the tower and <em>The Platform</em> lead down to the
    floor of the western section of the enclosure.</p>

  <p>In the western section the floor along the base of the main wall is
    buried in débris to a depth of 1 ft. 6 in. to 5 ft. From the base
    of the northern wall of this section to the centre of the area is a
    cemented floor laid on a pavement of blocks, but in some places the
    cement has become decomposed. In the west corner of this section of the
    enclosure is a floor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span> raised 3 ft. above the cement floor, but this is
    very roughly built, and appears to have been a filling-in by some late
    occupiers of the temple. On the east side of this raised floor, and
    acting as its retaining wall on that side, are the remains of a wall
    4 ft. high and 4 ft. wide projecting from the reconstructed portion
    of the north wall, and most probably of even a later date than the
    obviously reconstructed wall, seeing that it is built up against it.</p>

  <p>In the angle formed by the 28-ft. section of the north wall of the
    western area and the wall of <em>The Platform</em> is a set of “blind
    steps,” two in number, and with a platform 8 ft. by 6 ft. square,
    the steps and the platform being covered with granite cement (see
    <cite>Architecture</cite>—<cite>Blind Steps</cite>).</p>

  <p>Small portions of granite cement are to be found in the joints of
    the blocks of the main wall up to a height of 7 ft., and also to
    a similar height on the north wall of the eastern section of this
    enclosure, while in the angle of this latter wall and the buttress
    built up against it are the remains of a granite cement dado (see
    <cite>Architecture</cite>—<cite>Cement Dadoes</cite>).</p>

  <h3>THE CONICAL TOWER<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></h3>

  <p>This celebrated tower, which forms one of the chief architectural
    features of the Zimbabwe ruins, stands in the centre of the Sacred
    Enclosure, dividing it into two areas. The south-east of the tower is 3
    ft. 10 in. from the main wall of the temple (at 255 ft.) from the south
    side of the west entrance. It is 31 ft. high on its south-east face; 30
    ft. on the south-west side; 26 ft. 6 in. on its north-east side; and
    29 ft. on the north-west side. These measurements are taken from the
    actual foundation, which is only a few inches below the granite cement
    flooring surrounding its base on all sides but the north. The average
    height of the reduced summit of the tower in 1894 was 32 ft., and it
    was then far more level than as seen to-day. Bent believed the original
    height <span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>to have been 35 ft., at which point he thought it once had a
    level top, 4 ft in diameter. Photographs taken in 1891 give a very good
    impression of what the tower was like previous to the dilapidation,
    which took place immediately after that time.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to state the exact circumference of the base throughout
    the extent of the foundations, as a granite cement raised floor, with
    steps, is constructed up against the base of the north side, but it may
    be taken to be about 57 ft. 6 in. The measurements of the circumference
    of the tower at different heights are as follows: at 5 ft. above floor
    53 ft. 8 in.; at 10 ft., 50 ft. 4 in.; at 15 ft., 46 ft. 1 in.; at
    20 ft., 39 ft.; at 25 ft., 32 ft.; at 27 ft. 6 in. (where the broken
    portion of the summit commences), 30 ft. 2 in. The average battering
    back of the tower, so far as the broken edges of the present summit
    will permit of approximately correct measurements being taken, is, at
    the following heights, as follows: at 10 ft. above floor 1 ft. 7 in.;
    at 15 ft., 1 ft. 10 in.; at 20 ft., 2 ft. 6 in.; at 25 ft., 4 ft. 2
    in.; and at 27 ft., 5 ft. 5 in.</p>

  <p>The battering is far more regular on the west and south sides, where it
    is also a few inches less severe. To secure the inclining back of the
    sides of the cone, the blocks from front to back on its circumference
    are laid on the flat on a dead level, and yet so slightly do the blocks
    of one course lie back beyond the edge of the faces of the blocks
    of the course below that, except at one or two points, it is almost
    impossible to notice where the batter takes place. Even the blocks in
    the bulge on the north side have been ascertained to be still perfectly
    level.</p>

  <p>There is a slight bulging on the east and north-east sides at 10 ft.
    to 15 ft. above the floor, and this somewhat reduces the extent of
    battering-back on those sides at that height. This bulging creates an
    optical delusion, for visitors almost always declare that the tower has
    tilted slightly to the north-east. But this tilting has now been proved
    not to exist.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span> There are many causes which may have brought about
    the bulging. A large branch of hard-wood tree, the trunk of which is
    believed to have been over one hundred years old, had for years, even
    in light breezes, scraped up and down this side of the tower, and also
    it was on this side that most of the monkey rope, creepers, and bushes
    were growing out of the crevices of the tower from base to summit.</p>

  <p>The foundations are exceedingly shallow, being only some 10 in. to 18
    in. below the granite cement flooring. The foundation of the main wall
    near this point is only 10 in. below the same flooring. The lowest
    course of blocks of the tower is of the average size of the blocks used
    in the face of the structure. These rest on what was originally granite
    cement, but which, with the dripping of storm water for centuries
    down the large area of the face of the tower, has now become mere
    yellow sand. This, however, remains very firm, and still makes a good
    foundation. The foundations have not at any point sunk below their
    original level, but there are evidences that its enormous weight has
    caused the tower to settle firmly on to its bed.</p>

  <p>The present reduced summit of the tower, where it is intact, slants
    down from the west and south and south-east edges some 4 ft. towards
    the north-east, but the block débris on the summit only slants for 2
    ft. in the same direction. In the centre of the summit is a hole sunk
    down into the top of the tower some 4 ft. It will be remembered that
    Dr. Karl Mauch (1871) admitted having made this hole for the purpose
    of ascertaining whether the tower was solid. The hole was once much
    deeper, but debris has filled it up to 4 ft. from the summit. Mauch
    also made a second hole in the west face of the tower at 5 ft. from
    the floor. This also showed the tower to be solid. Theodore Bent
    (1891) also made a hole for a similar purpose. This is on the south
    face, and extends from the foundation to 4 ft. above the flooring, and
    he pronounced the tower to be perfectly solid. A certain Rhodesian,
    bent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span> as he confessed, on finding “The Treasure Chamber”(!), made
    another hole on the east side, at 5 ft. from the ground, and with the
    same result, but this hole is so neatly built up afresh that it can
    only just be located. The hole made by Mauch remained unbuilt up until
    1902, and several courses above it have consequently sagged. In 1902 a
    thin wire rod inserted in this last hole and passed through joints of
    internal dry masonry for 8 ft. towards the centre showed the tower to
    be solid.</p>

  <p>The dentelle pattern, which Mauch stated ran round the eastern portion
    of the summit of the tower, is now represented by only ten blocks.
    These form three sets of double courses of the dentelle pattern, as
    on the summit of the eastern face of the Eastern Temple on the hill,
    and two blocks of a lower course more to the east, and two loose
    dentelle blocks lying on the summit of the tower. One extremity of the
    pattern was undoubtedly, as can be seen on close inspection, facing
    the south-east, but it extended some little distance round towards the
    east, but how far it is now quite impossible to ascertain. Mauch owned
    to having destroyed a portion of the pattern in making the hole on the
    summit.</p>

  <p>The pattern was formed by two rows of wedge-shaped blocks placed to
    project 2 in. beyond the face of the wall, while above them, just as in
    the dentelle patterns elsewhere, were placed heavy blocks and throughs
    or ties, as if to bind effectively the stones forming the patterns,
    as the introduction of a decorative pattern in ancient walls anywhere
    in Rhodesia can be seen to have proved a point of weakness in the
    durability of the faces of the walls. The summit of the tower has been
    greatly dilapidated by small trees and bushes growing on the top, the
    stumps and roots of which can still be seen.</p>

  <p>The best idea of the symmetry and accuracy of the contour of the tower
    can be obtained by standing on the summit of the main wall, near the
    top of the visitors’ ladder.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span></p>

  <h3>THE SMALL TOWER</h3>

  <p>The base of this stands in <em>Sacred Enclosure</em> (<em>east</em>), at 5 ft. 2 in.
    north-east of the large tower. Its circumference at the cement floor
    is 21 ft. 7 in. At 4 ft. above the floor it has a circumference of 19
    ft. 10 in., the dilapidation not being so serious as to prevent this
    measurement being taken. The present reduced height is as follows: west
    side, 3 ft. 2 in.; south side, 4 ft. 6 in.; east side, 6 ft. 6 in.; and
    north side, 5 ft. 3 in.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately this tower, which Bent proved to have been solid, has,
    within the last few years, been subject to serious dilapidation.
    Photographs taken in 1894 are now but a record of the appearance of
    this tower at that time, for now, on comparing the photographs with the
    tower, they have become obsolete. A large branch of the tall hard-wood
    tree, which stands 3 ft. from the east side of this tower, had thrown
    over the summit on to the floor on the west side, and in 1902 nothing
    of the tower was left save the outer face of the wall, the internal
    blocks having been taken out by some unauthorised relic prospectors.
    These were replaced, and all the blocks which belong to the tower
    preserved.</p>

  <p>Bent (p. 115) states:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The religious purport of these towers would seem to be
      conclusively proved by the numerous finds we made in other
      parts of the ruins of a phallic nature, and I think a quotation
      from Montfaucon’s <cite>L’Antiquité Expliquée</cite> will give us the
      keynote of the worship: ‘The ancients assure us that all the
      Arabians worshipped a tower, which they called El Acara,
      or Alquetila, which was built by their patriarch, Ismael,’
      ‘Maximus of Tyre says they honoured as a great god a great
      cut-stone. This is apparently the same stone resembling Venus,
      according to Euthymius Zygabenus. When the Saracens were
      converted to Christianity they were obliged to anathematise
      this stone, which formerly they worshipped.’ This tower (at
      Zimbabwe) doubtless corresponded to the sacred <span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>tower of the
      Midianites, called Penuel, or the ‘Face of God,’ which Gideon
      destroyed (Judges viii. 7). Allusions to these towers are
      constant in the Bible, and the Arabian historian, El Masoudi
      (940 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), further tells us that this stone or
      tower was eight cubits high, and was placed in an angle of
      the temple, which had no roof. Turning to Phœnician temple
      construction, we have a good parallel to the ruins of the Great
      Zimbabwe at Byblos (in Phœnicia), as depicted on the coins; the
      tower, or sacred cone, is set up within the temple precincts,
      and shut off in an enclosure. Similar work is also found in the
      round temples of the Cabiri, at Hadjar Kem, in Malta, and the
      construction of these buildings bears a remarkable resemblance
      to that of those at Zimbabwe, and the round towers, or nuraghs,
      found in Sardinia may possibly be of similar significance. MM.
      Perrot and Chapiez, in their <cite>History of Art in Sardinia</cite>,
      speak of these nuraghs as forts or temples, around which the
      primitive inhabitants of the island once lived. They are
      truncated cones, built with stone blocks of different sizes,
      narrowing at the top. The stones are unhewn as a rule, and
      laid on without mortar. Here, too, we have a parallel for our
      monoliths, mention of unhewn stone, and also for the phalli,
      specimens of which are to be found carved on stone, and here,
      too, the intricate plan of the fortresses suggests at once a
      parallel to those at Zimbabwe; hence it would appear that the
      same influence was at work in Sardinia as in South Africa. In
      Lucian’s <cite>De Syria Dea</cite> we find a description of a temple at
      Hierapolis, in Mesopotamia, in the propylæa of which, he tells
      us (p. 16), ‘there stood two very large phalli, about thirty
      cubits high.’ Our tower at Zimbabwe stood apparently twenty
      cubits high, and ten in diameter. He further says (p. 29),
      ‘these phalli are solid, for when a priest had to ascend he had
      to put a rope round himself and walk up.’”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Dr. Schlichter, 1898, remarks:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“We have in the Great Zimbabwe an enormous gnomon (dial
      calculating point) before us, comprising a total angle of 120°.
      Taking all the details into account, I found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
      that the obliquity of the ecliptic was somewhat more than 23°
      52´, which brings us (considering that we have a good Chinese
      observation of the same period) to a time somewhat 1100
      <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> for the erection of the Zimbabwe ruins.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>THE PARALLEL PASSAGE</h3>

  <p>This passage, which is one of the most interesting features of ancient
    architecture at Zimbabwe, is 220 ft. long, and extends from (329 ft.)
    from the <em>West Entrance</em> to (513 ft.) from the same point, and runs
    along the inside of the east and north-east of the main wall of the
    temple, that is, from the <em>Sacred Enclosure</em> to the <em>North Entrance</em> of
    the temple.</p>

  <p>The ancient priests could by means of this long, deep, and exceedingly
    narrow passage reach the <em>Sacred Enclosure</em> from the exterior of the
    temple altogether unobserved, seeing that along its whole length it has
    no communication with any other part of the interior of the temple. It
    is therefore possible that this passage might have been exclusively
    used by the ministers of the sacred rites. In it have been found the
    bulk of the phalli yet discovered at Zimbabwe, and a number of both
    plain and decorated phalli were found here in August, 1902, when the
    débris which had covered its floor was being removed. The same surmise
    might be made with regard to the purpose of the <em>Parallel Passage</em> at
    the <em>Western Temple</em> on the <em>Acropolis</em>.</p>

  <p>The summit of the main wall on the outer side throughout the length
    of the passage averages from 28 ft. to 31 ft. above its present floor
    (see <em>Tables of Measurements of Main Walls</em>). The inner parallel wall
    varies in height, owing to dilapidations caused by past and present
    trees. This wall averages from 8 ft. to 16 ft. in height. The long
    and narrow passage between such high walls imparts a most weird and
    romantic aspect to this portion of the temple. The high, magnificently
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>sweeping, and massive walls tower on either side for a considerable
    distance on a bold masterly curve that displays in the well-built
    and regular courses of the walls design and workmanship which always
    strongly impress the modern builder with unfeigned surprise and wonder.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_246">
    <img src="images/i_246.jpg" width="494" height="700" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">THE PARALLEL PASSAGE, FROM SOUTH, ELLIPTICAL TEMPLE</div>
  </div>

  <p>At the extremity near the <em>Sacred Enclosure</em> the passage is 4 ft. wide,
    but at 30 ft. further north-east it is 3 ft. 6 in. wide, at 55 ft. it
    narrows to 2 ft. 6 in., which width is maintained for about 40 ft., at
    the end of which it widens out owing to the inner parallel wall being
    here built upon a comparatively straight line. At (440 ft.) it is 4 ft.
    6 in. wide, at (460 ft.) 5 ft. 6 in. wide, at (480 ft.) 7 ft., and at
    (513 ft.), which is its northern extremity, it narrows to 2 ft. 6 in.
    Between (490 ft.) and (513 ft.) there is a large gap in the main wall,
    where its inner face has collapsed into the passage. The bottom of the
    gap is about 6 ft. above the present level of the passage floor.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_247">
    <img src="images/i_247.jpg" width="600" height="323" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>West Entrance to</i><br />PARALLEL PASSAGE<br />Elliptical Temple</div>
  </div>

  <p>Between (349 ft.) and (362 ft.) the inner parallel wall has collapsed
    into the passage, but the débris has now been cleared away. Between
    (470 ft.) and (500 ft.) the inner wall has been reduced by falls to a
    height of only 6 ft. 9 in.</p>

  <p>The north wall of the <em>Sacred Enclosure</em> (<em>east</em>) is continued for
    55 ft. as the west wall of the passage. This section is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span> obviously
    a reconstruction of a later date, the joints with this wall and the
    rest of the older and better-built wall at the south end can be seen
    near the small conical tower in the <em>Sacred Enclosure</em>, the opposite
    side of this joint being distinctly noticeable in <em>No. 11 Enclosure</em>.
    The joint at the north-eastern end of this reconstructed section of
    wall can be seen near (375 ft.), where the older wall recommences.
    This less excellently reconstructed wall shows a far greater amount
    of dilapidation than does the older portion. This circumstance is to
    be noticed in more than a score of other instances of reconstruction
    of lengths of older walls, the invariable experience in Zimbabwe
    architecture being that the reconstructed portions are much less
    lasting, although they are of later date, and these reconstructions
    always show a depression in their summits at the joints with the older
    portions of the wall.</p>

  <p>The entrance into this passage from the <em>Sacred Enclosure</em> is the east
    entrance mentioned in the description of that enclosure, and is at (320
    ft.). It is formed by rounded buttresses, 7 ft. high, on either side of
    the passage. The entrance is 2 ft. 6 in. wide, 9 ft. long (including
    the steps at either end), and has portcullis grooves of unusually large
    size. It is approached from the <em>Sacred Enclosure</em> by three large,
    broad, and deep block steps, which are still in a very good state of
    preservation, not one block being missing or even out of place. The
    floor is excellently paved with blocks. On the passage side of the
    entrance are three block steps also in a splendid condition, but these
    are narrower, as the rounded foundation of the west buttress projects 7
    in. into the passage further than the upper portion of the buttress.</p>

  <p>Immediately inside this entrance, and against the base of the main
    wall, is a raised level with rounded edges made of granite cement.
    This is 7 ft. long, 1 ft. 10 in. wide, and 3 in. higher than cement
    flooring, and 6 in. high at its north-east end above a step-down in the
    floor. Between this raised <span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>cement level and the west wall of the
    passage is a cemented floor 4 ft. 4 in. long, with a rounded face at
    its north-east end, this face forming the step-down just mentioned. The
    floor from this point northwards to (335 ft.) has been broken through
    by excavators, but from (335 ft.) northwards to (425 ft.) the cement
    flooring still remains intact. From (425 ft.) to the northern end of
    the passage the floor has been torn up by explorers.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_248">
    <img src="images/i_248.jpg" width="459" height="700" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">PARALLEL PASSAGE, FROM NORTH, ELLIPTICAL TEMPLE</div>
  </div>

  <p>Evidently the ancients were thoroughly well versed in the art of
    sanitation, for the lengths of cemented flooring are divided into
    catchment areas, separated from each other by raised step-barriers 4
    in. high, 3 ft. 10 in. broad, laid across the passage. These are made
    of granite cement and have rounded edges. The floor has a slight fall
    on either side of these raised barriers, and in the lowest part of
    each area is a drain-hole passing through the main wall, the object
    evidently being to divide up the rainfall so that each drain should
    only have such a quantity of water as its capacity would allow it to
    carry off. The drain-holes passing outwards and downwards through the
    main walls are at (352 ft.), (391 ft. 6 in.), (442 ft.), and (471 ft.).
    These are believed to have once been lined with yellow granite cement.
    It is possible that other drains from this passage-way may yet be found.</p>

  <p>Near (396 ft.) is a drain-hole leading into the passage from <em>No. 14 Enclosure</em>.</p>

  <p>The floor at the extreme north end of the passage has not yet been
    uncovered, as it would be unsafe to remove any more depth of soil owing
    to the threatening condition of the wall at the gap before mentioned.</p>

  <p>Near (338 ft.) is a flat granite beam 6 ft. long, which has evidently
    fallen from the summit of the main wall.</p>

  <p>The <em>Parallel Passage</em> and <em>Sacred Enclosure</em> were used by old and
    recent generations of Makalanga as places in which to deposit their
    ash, pottery, iron, and bone débris, and this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span> was found in places to
    a height of 3 ft. and 4 ft. The bones were of animals, mostly of buck,
    but some of oxen, and all had been split open for the marrow, as is
    usually found to be the case in all Makalanga débris heaps whether at
    any ruins or at their villages. Being sunless and damp these two places
    for occupation purposes appear to have been avoided by them.</p>

  <h3>8a. THE PLATFORM</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap">THIS is a raised platform standing immediately in front of the
    <em>Conical Tower</em> at a distance of 4 ft. from north to north-west. The
    proximity of this structure to the <em>Conical Tower</em>, its position in
    front of it, its summit commanding a view of the interior of the
    temple, particularly of the interior of the <em>Sacred Enclosure</em>, its
    peculiar form as compared with other structures in the temple, and the
    excellent workmanship displayed in its walls, as well as the decoration
    of green chlorite schist on its east wall, would appear to show that
    it possessed some highly important significance in the minds of the
    ancient worshippers. So much is this so that visitors most frequently
    remark that this structure must have been the “pulpit” from which the
    priests addressed the crowd of worshippers.</p>

  <p><em>The Platform</em> possesses no angular feature. Its plan is oval, the
    entrance is rounded, and the curves of the walls are excellently worked
    out. The southern and eastern half of this building now only remains
    intact, the northern half, though still traceable, having been pushed
    over northwards by a huge tree.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>

  <p>The inside area of the southern half is 14 ft. from north to south, and
    16 ft. from east to west. The heights of its sides are as follows: east
    side, 9 ft. from granite cement step on floor of <em>No. 11 Enclosure</em>;
    west side, 10 ft. above floor of <em>No. 9 Enclosure</em>, including 3 ft.
    height of terraced wall; south side, 12 ft. above floor of <em>Sacred
    Enclosure</em> (<em>west</em>), and 11 ft. from top of “blind steps” in the same
    enclosure; the north side is ruined. The wall on its present summit is
    from 2 ft. to 2 ft. 6 in. wide.</p>

  <p>On the inside, and at a height of from 2 ft. to 4 ft. below the summit
    of the wall, is a raised platform 2 ft. wide running round the inside
    of the wall. This platform, which, in fact, is banquette work, is
    paved with stones, and these are covered with granite cement. This
    banquette was approached by well steps ascending up in the centre of
    the interior, and these were made of blocks covered with granite cement.</p>

  <p>The entrance to <em>The Platform</em> is on the north-east side, but only one
    side is now remaining. It is 9 ft. high and is rounded. The large upper
    granite cement step on the floor of <em>No. 11 Enclosure</em> led up to this
    entrance. The decorative pattern on the outer face of the north-east
    wall is described in the account of <em>No. 11 Enclosure</em>.</p>

  <p>This <em>Platform</em> appears to have served an identical purpose as that of
    the elevated <em>Platform</em> at the <em>Western Temple</em> on the <em>Acropolis</em>, and
    as that of the <em>Ancient Balcony</em> which commands the interior of the
    <em>Eastern Temple</em> on <em>Zimbabwe Hill</em>.</p>

  <p>Bent stated that in 1891 a tall unhewn granite monolith stood erect
    immediately north of <em>The Platform</em>, but there is no trace now of its
    existence, and several old residents of Victoria say it must have
    disappeared before they first visited the ruins.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The positions
    of all three of the platforms suggest some purpose in the ancient
    religious services.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

  <h3>NO. 9 ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>This enclosure lies to the north of the western end of <em>Sacred
    Enclosure</em> (<em>west</em>), to the east of <em>No. 7 Enclosure</em>, to the west
    of <em>The Platform</em>, and to the south of the south passage to <em>No. 10
    Enclosure</em> and of <em>No. 10 Enclosure</em>.</p>

  <p>Its area is: north side, 26 ft; west side, 26 ft.; east side, 42 ft.;
    and south side, 24 ft.</p>

  <p>The south side is formed by the wall dividing this enclosure from
    <em>Sacred Enclosure</em> (<em>west</em>), and this is 9 ft. high, and shows the two
    classes of building as does the opposite side. The west side for 6 ft.
    from its south end is formed by a wall of this length, and which is 6
    ft. high. This wall at its northern end terminates abruptly and leans
    northwards, being supported by a bank of soil débris. The rest of this
    side is formed by the bank of soil débris as far as the south passage
    to <em>No. 10 Enclosure</em>. The north side is formed by the south wall of
    that passage and of <em>No. 10 Enclosure</em>. The passage wall is 6 ft. high,
    and the enclosure wall 8 ft. high. The east side for 14 ft. from the
    south end is formed by <em>The Platform</em>, and a terraced wall projecting
    westwards for from 5 ft. to 7 ft. The rest of the eastern side was an
    open space, until recently covered with soil débris.</p>

  <p>An entrance from <em>Sacred Enclosure</em> (<em>west</em>) is in the south-west
    corner, and this is described in the account of that enclosure. This
    entrance on the north side has two stone steps covered with granite
    cement. The entrance from <em>No. 10 Enclosure</em> is described in the
    account of the passage to that enclosure.</p>

  <p>At the south side there is a mass of granite cement rendered shapeless
    by roots of trees and creepers, and also considerably decomposed by
    annual accumulations of rain-water, as this is the lowest part of the
    enclosure. Traces of rounded faces can be seen at several points in
    this cement.</p>

  <p>On the eastern side the floor is made of granite cement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span> This is only
    4 in. thick, and underneath it are several thin layers of floors made
    of granite cement.</p>

  <p>It is believed that the angle between <em>The Platform</em> and the south wall
    once held “blind steps.” The quantity of decomposed granite cement
    found in this corner, together with traces of two steps on the terraced
    wall, rather confirms this belief.</p>

  <h3>NO. 10 ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>This enclosure lies on the north side of <em>No. 7 Enclosure</em>. Until
    August, 1902, nothing was known concerning it, nor could it have been
    examined during the last fifty years. The Makalanga, as previously
    stated, whose last occupation of the temple as a kraal was some sixty
    years ago, had filled it in with stones and rubble and laid a common
    clay floor over the filling-in, as was their usual practice in almost
    all the ancient ruins in Rhodesia which they occupied. On this clay
    floor was built a circular hut of clay. The filling-in completely
    buried portions of the walls of the enclosure.</p>

  <p>In addition to this filling-in, the area had been used as a
    dumping-ground for soil excavated from neighbouring enclosures, and
    so much so that the soil heap was at least 6 ft. higher than the
    filling-in by the Makalanga, and it contained some twenty-five tons of
    soil, all of which has now been removed.</p>

  <p>In form the enclosure has the shape of a quarter of a section of a
    circle, the square sides being on the south and west.</p>

  <p>The south side is 27 ft. 6 in. long, the south entrance to this
    enclosure being at 20 ft. to 23 ft. from the west end. The south wall
    is the divisional wall between <em>No. 7 Enclosure</em> and this enclosure.
    It is massive and very well built, and is still from 6 ft. to 7 ft. in
    height.</p>

  <p>The west side is 31 ft. 6 in. in length. The first 21 ft. from its
    south end is well built, and is in a good state of preservation save
    for a reduction in its summit. It is 4 ft.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span> wide at present level of
    ground. The northern extremity of the 21-ft. length is rounded. The
    wall at its southern end is 8 ft. high, but for 10 ft. at its northern
    end it averages only 4 ft. to 5 ft. in height. At 21 ft. to 23 ft.
    along the west side of the enclosure is the western entrance, the
    northern side of which is formed by a rounded buttress, now only 2 ft.
    in height. The rest of the wall towards the north is very dilapidated.</p>

  <p>The east side, which curves outwards towards the east, measures 40 ft.
    along the face of the wall. The length of 27 ft. from the north end is
    formed by a wall of this length, which is 3 ft. to 4 ft. high and 3 ft.
    wide. This wall is obviously of poor and late construction as compared
    with the west and south wall of this enclosure, and crosses in the
    middle of its length, at right angles, an old substantial foundation
    running east and west. The foundation of the upper wall is laid on the
    block and soil débris on the summit of the buried wall. Probably this
    buried wall was the north side of this enclosure at a lower level, and
    this would have once made the enclosure square in form. The eastern
    wall terminates at its south end with an angular buttress 2 ft. 6 in.
    wide, which protrudes westerly 16 in. into the enclosure, where it
    terminates abruptly in a broken end. From the 27-ft. point to the sound
    end of the wall is a very well-built substantial wall 4 ft. 6 in. wide
    at base, but for 5 ft. from its north end it is 1 ft. only above the
    present floor, but for the rest of its length it is 6 ft. in height.
    Where the wall so rises in height it is rounded across the wall, and
    this may have been the south side of an eastern entrance into the
    enclosure.</p>

  <p>Though this enclosure has been cleared, the coarse red clay of the
    Makalanga still remains in the centre of the area, but in the angles of
    this enclosure and along its south side is some yellow granite cement
    of a far greater age.</p>

  <p>On the yellow granite cement a quantity of what appear to have
    been gold-burnishing tools were found. All these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span> were originally
    water-worn, but showed signs of having been artificially worn as tools.
    Five of these showed gold richly on the sides used for burnishing,
    others also showed gold. This was the only enclosure in this temple
    where such tools were found, and the number of them discovered at and
    near one spot suggests that this enclosure was in pre-Kafir occupation
    days a gold-burnisher’s workshop, just as <em>No. 7 Enclosure</em> was
    evidently a goldsmith’s workshop, while for corresponding reasons <em>No.
    6 Enclosure</em> was a chief place for the smelting of gold. A quantity
    of pottery made of soapstone clay, the first of such pottery yet
    discovered, was found in this enclosure.</p>

  <h3>SOUTH APPROACH TO NO. 10 ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>This is formed by a passage 10 ft. long, which enters this enclosure
    at its south-east corner. It is probable that this passage was much
    longer, and that it once extended to the north-west corner of the
    <em>Sacred Enclosure</em>, where is an entrance facing the passage.</p>

  <p>The west side of the passage is formed by a wall 14 ft. 6 in. long, 4
    ft. high, and 3 ft. 6 in. on its present reduced summit, which wall is
    also the east wall of <em>No. 7 Enclosure</em>.</p>

  <p>On the east side is a very well-built wall 10 ft. 6 in. long, 4 ft.
    6 in. high, and 3 ft. wide on its present summit, with a finely
    constructed rounded end tapering upwards and facing south. The rounded
    end is 7 ft. high, and rises from the floor of <em>No. 9 Enclosure</em>, which
    is on the east side but on a lower level.</p>

  <p>The south end of the passage is 4 ft. wide, but the north end is 6 ft.
    6 in. wide, but is narrowed to 2 ft. 6 in. by a rounded buttress 4 ft.
    6 in. high, and this and the rounded wall opposite, which forms the
    other side of the entrance, have upright portcullis-like grooves.</p>

  <p>The floor of the passage is paved with flat shallow stones covered for
    2 in. in depth with granite cement.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span></p>

  <h3>NO. 11 ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>This immediately adjoins on the north side of <em>Sacred Enclosure</em>
    (<em>east</em>). On the west side it is bounded by <em>The Platform</em>, on the east
    by a large rounded buttress which separates it from <em>No. 12 Enclosure</em>,
    but its northern boundary, if any, is at present difficult to determine.</p>

  <p>Through this enclosure is the northern entrance to the <em>Sacred
    Enclosure</em>, and this entrance is within 8 ft. of the north face of the
    <em>Conical Tower</em>. Evidently both from its close proximity to the <em>Sacred
    Enclosure</em>, the <em>Tower</em>, and <em>The Platform</em>, the ancient occupiers
    considered this enclosure to be of importance, and the splendid
    construction of the massive steps leading toward the tower would appear
    to further confirm the correctness of this conjecture.</p>

  <p>The area is, south side 18 ft.; west 14 ft.; east 14 ft.; and north 17 ft.</p>

  <p>The wall on the south side is 13 ft. high at its western end, but
    is reduced by dilapidation to 6 ft. at the entrance to the <em>Sacred
    Enclosure</em>. At its highest point are five parallel horizontal bands
    of green chlorite schist<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> separated from each other by two courses
    of granite blocks. This wall is excellently built, and most patently
    differs in style and excellence of construction from the same wall
    which also forms the southern side of <em>No. 12 Enclosure</em>, and the
    difference strongly suggests that during the later ancient occupation
    the part of the wall which was continued into the adjoining enclosure
    fell down and was rebuilt only in a poorer style. This can also be seen
    on the opposite face of the wall in the <em>Sacred Enclosure</em>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

  <p>The wall on the west side is the outer face of the east wall of <em>The
    Platform</em>. This is 9 ft. high, measuring from the granite cement step
    at its base, and 10 ft. long. At the north end of this wall, which is
    rounded, is the approach to the summit of <em>The Platform</em>. On the face
    of this wall, and starting from the entrance to the <em>Sacred Enclosure</em>,
    is a decoration of seven parallel and horizontal rows of green chlorite
    schist, with two courses of granite blocks between each. Each row
    begins close up to the entrance, but all terminate towards the north of
    the wall, each lower row extending some 6 in. more north than the one
    above it.</p>

  <p>On the east side the rounded buttress projects 6 ft. 6 in. from the
    south wall, and is still 4 ft. 6 in. high, and 11 ft. long measuring
    towards the east. This length may be divided into two portions, the
    eastern part which is angular and of poor construction, being in all
    probability a later erection to support the joint in the superior and
    poorer portions of the south wall, also the western portion already
    described. On the north side of this buttress is a granite cement floor
    raised 4 in. above the floor of the enclosure, and the step is rounded
    along its edge. The western and northern sides of this buttress were
    once faced with granite cement 3 in. thick in the form of a dado. A
    portion of this cement still remains on the north side, and the quality
    of the cement is identical with the cement found in dado fashion on the
    faces of other walls in the temple and on the <em>Acropolis</em>. The eastern
    addition to this buttress does not appear ever to have had a cemented
    dado.</p>

  <p>The most striking features of this enclosure are its most excellent
    granite cement floor and its massive rounded steps. Until October,
    1902, this enclosure was filled up to a height of 5 ft. above the
    present opened-out floors. The lowest strata of filling-in, 2 ft.
    thick, had been made by rains washing in the soil from adjoining and
    higher enclosures, the drain-hole through the south wall having become
    blocked. There was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>no vegetable matter in this stratum. The stratum
    of filling-in above the lowest one was a deliberate filling-in and
    levelling-up by Makalanga of a very early period, for this débris
    contained articles such as pottery, assegai-heads, clay whorls, which,
    though strongly resembling those of the present Makalanga pattern, were
    of a somewhat better quality than those made by them either to-day or
    within the last few generations. This stratum of filling-in was done
    at one and the same time, for the line of stratification was perfect
    and unbroken. Above this stratum was one of ordinary <i>daga</i> (clay) and
    not cement, and this contained articles more closely resembling those
    of present Makalanga make, but this stratum must have been filled in,
    judging by the quantity of débris found, more than seventy years ago,
    for according to local native accounts it was fully seventy years ago
    when the Makalanga ceased to occupy the <em>Elliptical Temple</em> as a place
    of residence, though sacrifices of oxen on certain feast days, as
    mentioned by Mauch, Phillips, and Bent, and local chiefs, took place in
    the temple down to thirty years ago, if not somewhat later. Above this
    stratum and forming the surface was a stratum of very rich leaf mould
    about 18 in. thick, and this was matted with vegetable growth.</p>

  </div>

  <p>On digging out the roots of a large parent monkey-rope tree, which
    had done considerable damage to the south wall of this enclosure, and
    which tree appears in all the old photographs of the <em>Conical Tower</em>,
    a section of an ancient floor was discovered at a depth of 5 ft. Some
    twenty tons of filling-in were removed, and the whole of the cement
    floor as seen to-day was exposed. The old visitors’ path crossed this
    enclosure 5 ft. above this cement floor.</p>

  <p>The cement work in this enclosure is most excellent, hardly a scratch
    being seen upon its surface. It is the finest and most perfect specimen
    yet found either at Zimbabwe or any ancient ruin in Rhodesia. The
    granite powder in the cement is so firmly set that picks cannot make
    any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span> impression upon it. This flooring averages 18 in. to 2 ft. in
    thickness, and must rest on a splendid foundation, for the levels of
    the floor are almost true to this day.</p>

  <p>A large cement step runs north and south at 2 ft. from the west side.
    This is 14 in. high and 5 ft. long, but originally, according to its
    curve and traces of its continuation, 7 ft. long. The step which has a
    rounded edge forms the lower portion of the approach to <em>The Platform</em>.</p>

  <p>A second step runs from north to south at 5 ft. from the front of the
    first step, and slightly curves out eastwards. This step is 12 ft.
    high, 11 ft. 6 in. long, and has a boldly rounded edge. The floor has a
    slight fall to the south-east corner, where is a drain-hole which has
    its exit near the small tower in <em>Sacred Enclosure</em> (<em>east</em>).</p>

  <p>The entrance to the <em>Sacred Enclosure</em>, which is in the south-west
    corner of this enclosure, is 2 ft. 6 in. wide, is rounded, and has
    portcullis grooves on either side.</p>

  <h3>NO. 12 ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>This immediately adjoins <em>No. 11 Enclosure</em> on its north-east side.
    Its east wall for 28 ft. is formed by west wall of <em>Sacred Enclosure</em>
    (<em>east</em>), and for 21 ft. by the west wall of <em>Parallel Passage</em>. These
    walls are one, and curve outwards towards the east to the extent of 6
    ft. from a line drawn from end to end of the wall in this enclosure.
    This east wall is 49 ft. long and 10 ft. high, and from the angular
    buttress at the south-west corner has a banquette wall, 4 ft. high,
    projecting 1 ft. 6 in., and continued north-east for 32 ft. from the
    buttress. This wall is of inferior construction to the same wall on
    the east side of <em>No. 11 Enclosure</em>, the courses being most irregular,
    the stones ill-sorted, and there is no decoration on its face. The
    north-eastern portion is reduced to 3 ft. 6 in. in height for a length
    of 17 ft., the upper portion having fallen into <em>Parallel Passage</em>. The
    angular buttress in the south-west corner appears to have been built at
    a later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span> period, when the west wall of <em>Sacred Enclosure</em> (<em>east</em>) was
    rebuilt, for the buttress covers the joint between the original portion
    and the later portion, as if to strengthen the wall at this point.
    The north side for 12 ft. is formed by a wall of this length, which
    is 4 ft. high and 3 ft. 6 in. wide on its present summit. But it is
    impossible at present to define either the western boundary or those of
    the remainder of the north and south sides, owing to the fact that all
    divisional walls in this portion of the temple have been covered over
    and buried during the period of some later occupiers.</p>

  <p>In the angle formed by the east and south sides is a platform 6 ft.
    high and 11 ft. wide, which is approached by five steps, the platform
    and the steps being covered with granite cement. Similar steps and
    platforms are found in the angles of other enclosures both in the
    <em>Elliptical Temple</em> and in the ruins on the Acropolis. These are all
    remarkably alike in position, dimensions, and construction, and all
    appear to have answered an identical purpose. The sizes of the steps,
    the nearness of the lowest step to the walls preclude the suggestion
    that they were flights on the summits of the walls. (See <cite>Blind
    Steps</cite>—<cite>Architecture</cite>.)</p>

  <p>A drain passes under the small platform and it has cement rims to lead
    the water to it.</p>

  <h3>NO. 13 ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>This adjoins <em>No. 12 Enclosure</em> on the north side, the west side of the
    inner wall of the <em>Parallel Passage</em> forming its eastern boundary for
    25 ft. 6 in. This wall is 5 ft. high for 18 ft. from the south end of
    the enclosure, and 11 ft. 6 in. high for the last 7 ft. of its northern
    end.</p>

  <p>The south side is formed for 12 ft. by the wall separating this
    enclosure from <em>No. 12</em>, but <em>No. 13</em> being at a lower level, this wall
    is 6 ft. high from the present filled-in surface of the enclosure.</p>

  <p>The north and north-west side is formed by a wall 32 ft.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span> long, with a
    rounded entrance from <em>No. 14 Enclosure</em> between the 21-ft. and 23-ft.
    points of this length, measuring from the east end of this wall. The
    wall is fairly well built at its eastern end, where it is still 4 ft.
    high and 3 ft. 6 in. to 4 ft. wide on its present reduced summit. This
    wall is built upon a red cement foundation. The south-west end of the
    wall is very dilapidated, but appears to have been originally of good
    construction. [Owing to piles of soil débris on the south-west side of
    this enclosure, it is impossible at present to define the exact limits
    on that side, but the shape of the enclosure is that of a keystone, its
    widest and rounded end being on the east side.]</p>

  <h3>NO. 14 ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>This enclosure, which is on the east side of the temple, is where the
    <em>Inner Parallel Passage</em> opens into the interior of the building. The
    area is 47 ft. from north to south, and 42 ft. east to west. It is open
    on the north and west sides where it adjoins <em>No. 15 Enclosure</em> and the
    <em>Central Area</em> respectively.</p>

  <p>The east side is formed by the south entrance to <em>Inner Parallel
    Passage</em> by the large buttress, 7 ft. high, projecting into, and
    forming, the south side of the entrance to that passage, and by a
    length of 17 ft. of the west wall of the large <em>Parallel Passage</em> which
    is here 14 ft. high.</p>

  <p>The south side is bounded by the divisional wall, 5 ft. high, between
    this enclosure and <em>No. 13 Enclosure</em>. In this wall is a rounded
    entrance between the two enclosures.</p>

  <p>The west side is open to the interior of the temple, but at 42 ft. in
    that direction there are traces of a wall running north and south which
    probably formed its west side.</p>

  <p>The north side was once formed by a wall of which traces can yet be
    seen, and which once divided this enclosure from <em>No. 15 Enclosure</em>.</p>

  <p>Projecting from the north face of the south wall are the remains of
    a sub-divisional wall. Several large, rounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span> structures of cement
    are on the south-west side of the enclosure. The topmost floor of the
    enclosure is made of a pinkish-coloured clay, which evidently has been
    burnt. Under this floor was found sections of carved soapstone beams,
    a few pieces of beaten gold, and other relics. On the surface of this
    floor only superior-made native articles were found, and the floor was
    covered by at least 2 ft. of rich black vegetable mould. Several trees
    which were growing in this enclosure have recently been removed.</p>

  <h3>NO. 15 ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>From an archæological point of view this enclosure is one of the most
    interesting compartments in the temple, for here are to be seen several
    layers of floors of a succession of occupiers each for a long period of time.</p>

  <p>In 1903 this enclosure was found to be filled in with soil, ashes, and
    bones to a depth of 12 ft., and on the top was a large tree at least
    seventy to a hundred years old. When this great body of filling-in
    was cleared away several most interesting architectural features were
    revealed.</p>

  <p>The area is 56 ft. from east to west, and at its widest point 18 ft.
    from north to south. The east, north, and west sides are formed by the
    south wall of the <em>Inner Parallel Passage</em>, and by a continuation of
    the same wall which curves outwards towards the north-west and forms
    the south wall of the <em>South Passage</em>. This wall is 12 ft. high all
    round and is well and massively built, the curve at the north-west end
    being exceedingly well carried out. A drain passes through the east end
    of the wall and opens into the <em>Inner Parallel Passage</em>.</p>

  <p>The south side is formed by two walls and a series of semi-circular
    cement buttresses. The first or western end wall is rounded, being 7
    ft. round the face and 8 ft. high. A straight wall joins on to the
    rounded length, and is 6 ft. 6 in. long and 7 ft. high. This length
    has a drain-hole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span> passing through it from the passage which forms
    the eastern approach to the <em>South Passage</em>. A large rounded cement
    buttress follows the two walls, and this is 14 ft. long and 7 ft. high.
    A length of a few feet of soil showing several floors at different
    heights is on the east side of the cement buttress, and another rounded
    cement buttress, 3 ft. high, completes the boundary of the enclosure on
    the south side.</p>

  <p>The lowest of the floors is formed of paving stones and granite cement,
    and the level of this is flush with the bottom course of blocks in the
    drain. But underneath this undoubtedly old floor, which was apparently
    laid down when the east wall was built, there are cement steps and
    buttresses at a depth of some 18 in. below the level of the drain.
    Underneath the floor were found two phalli, fragments of ornamented
    bowls and soapstone beams, clearly showing that the space underneath
    this lowest floor had been occupied before the floor was laid.</p>

  <p>A floor of a pinkish-coloured cement, similar to that found in other
    enclosures, is at some distance above the granite cement floor, and on
    this floor were found very old native articles and quantities of buck
    bones and ashes. Above this are floors of thin <i>daga</i> (clay), and on
    each of these were also bones and ashes and native articles which are
    not now manufactured.</p>

  <p>The position of the east wall of this enclosure and the fact of its
    covering some older enclosure seem to point to it as not being a
    portion of the original building.</p>

  <h3>CENTRAL AREA</h3>

  <p>This area of unexplored ground lies at the centre of the temple. It was
    originally very much larger, but recent excavations have reduced it in
    extent. The space covered is 80 ft. from east to west, and 30 ft. from
    north to south, and it extends between <em>Nos. 5 and 14 Enclosures</em>, and
    <em>Nos. 1 and 10 Enclosures</em>.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_264">
    <img src="images/i_264.jpg" width="600" height="434" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">S.E. INTERIOR OF ELLIPTICAL TEMPLE, LOOKING N.N.E.,
      SHEWING EXCAVATIONS ON PLATFORM AREA, 1902–4</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

  <p>Some plans of the temple show dotted lines to mark position of
    conjectured walls, but most of these have been found not to exist. On
    the surface of the highest portion of this area are slight walls of
    shallow foundations and poor construction built across soil and blocks
    thrown promiscuously together, and probably the blocks and the debris
    of some buried structures at a lower level.</p>

  <h3>PLATFORM AREA</h3>

  <p>Immediately in front of and adjoining the <em>Sacred Enclosure</em> in which
    stands the <em>Conical Tower</em>, and overlooked by <em>The Platform</em>, is
    a large open area in the form of a bow, the rounded side—east and
    south-east—being formed by <em>No. 9 Enclosure</em>, <em>The Platform</em>, and <em>Nos.
    11, 12, and 13 Enclosures</em>, while the straight side, from south-west
    to north-east, is formed by <em>Nos. 7 and 10 Enclosures</em>, a circular
    platform, and <em>No. 13 Enclosure</em>.</p>

  <p>The area covered by this open space is 126 ft. from south-west to
    north-east and 51 ft. from east to west. This space had not been
    previously examined by any modern explorer. Nor does any published plan
    of the temple attempt to deal with it, it having been always left as an
    unmarked space.</p>

  <p>Bent found a similarity between <em>The Platform</em> which overlooks this
    area from its east side and the <em>Agora</em> or platform-pulpit of the
    ancient temples in the Near East to which references are so frequently
    made in classic history, and he considered that this platform at
    Zimbabwe, especially in view of its position in front of the <em>Conical
    Tower</em>, was used for religious purposes, and that the open space
    immediately at its foot and in front of it most probably held the
    crowd of worshippers that might have been addressed from the elevated
    <em>Platform</em>.</p>

  <p>The examination of this area in 1903 shows that Bent in 1891 made a
    very shrewd conjecture as to the nature of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span> the area. Over twelve years
    ago and until 1903 the space held out a prospect of its containing
    under its surface any number of walls, for in the Elliptical Temple
    divisional walls and other structures are closely packed together.
    Now that the space for 126 ft. by 51 ft. has been cleared to a depth
    of from 4 ft. to 8 ft. following the lines of old cement floors which
    were completely buried, the space is shown to be actually an open area
    without walls or traces of walls of any sort crossing it at any point.
    Excepting such granite blocks as lined the bases of the boundary walls
    of this area, not ten hundred-weight of blocks were found, and these
    were scattered about at different heights and in almost every position
    in the soil débris which was removed.</p>

  <p>In excavating this large space down to the floor which runs throughout
    the area at a similar level—a work occupying, forty native labourers
    for three months—“finds” of any antique character were only made on the
    cleared floor and not in the soil débris which was removed, and all
    such relics which included fragments of both plain and carved soapstone
    beams, gold plates, beads and wire, were about equally distributed over
    the whole area.</p>

  <p>The most important architectural features disclosed in the clearing of
    this area were as follows:—</p>

  <p>Drain from <em>No. 10 Enclosure</em> into this area.</p>

  <p>A rounded terrace wall on the west side of <em>The Platform</em>.</p>

  <p>Excellent granite cement dado work, several square feet being still
    intact.</p>

  <p>Two massive granite cement steps leading up to the north entrance to
    the <em>Sacred Enclosure</em>.</p>

  <p>The large granite cement steps leading up to the small platform in the
    angle formed by the north and east walls of <em>No. 12 Enclosure</em>.</p>

  <p>Drain-hole in buttress in <em>No. 12 Enclosure</em> with large cement guides
    to lead water to it.</p>

  <p>The suggestion made in description of the slight and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>poorly built
    east wall of <em>No. 10 Enclosure</em> that it was of later construction is
    confirmed.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Circular granite cement platform with steps leading to summit.</p>

  <p>This last-mentioned structure is worthy of more than a mere mention;
    as apart from its excellent construction and its position, its summit
    was found to be covered with soapstone beams, plain and decorated,
    while fragments of beams were lying all round its base. Near this spot
    numerous soapstone phalli, including one of very large size, were
    discovered.</p>

  <p>This platform is 69 ft., N. 20, from the north face of the <em>Conical
    Tower</em> measured through the centre of the north entrance to the <em>Sacred
    Enclosure</em>. It has a circumference of 30 ft. 6 in., and is from 2 ft.
    4 in. to 2 ft. 8 in. in height, with a rounded bevel at base 3 in.
    high and projecting 6 in. There are two boldly rounded steps, each 8
    in. high, on the east side, and on the east side of the steps is a low
    cement parapet. This platform occupies a somewhat isolated position.
    Its summit was found to be buried for at least 2 ft. in soil. Close to
    the north side was a large tree, judged to have been almost one hundred
    years old. The roots of the tree had arched over and also encircled
    the structure, and so had preserved it. The roots had attempted to
    penetrate the cement, but failing to do so they passed completely round
    its face, and when cut away they were almost all semi-circular in shape.</p>

  <h3>INNER PARALLEL PASSAGE</h3>

  <p>This passage lies between the main <em>Parallel Passage</em> and <em>No. 15
    Enclosure</em>. It runs north-west to south-east from the <em>South Passage</em>
    near the <em>North Entrance</em> to the temple into <em>No. 15 Enclosure</em>, and
    is parallel with <em>Parallel Passage</em>. The three parallel walls forming
    the two passages are generally known as the <em>Triple Walls</em>. Whereas
    the <em>Parallel Passage</em> led from the <em>North Entrance</em> to the <em>Sacred
    Enclosure</em> only,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span> this leads from near the <em>North Entrance</em> right into
    the interior of the temple.</p>

  <p>Its length is 71 ft., and at its eastern end it is 7 ft. wide for a
    short distance, but rapidly closes in to a width of 3 ft. 6 in., which
    is maintained throughout the greatest part of its remaining length.</p>

  <p>The north-eastern wall is the south-western wall of the <em>Parallel
    Passage</em>, and from the eastern end for 29 ft. this wall averages in
    height 12 ft. to 14 ft. above the present floor of the passage, and
    from the 29-ft. point to 67 ft. the face of the wall is damaged by
    roots, and the height here is only 7 ft.</p>

  <p>The south-western side is formed by the wall dividing this passage from
    <em>No. 15 Enclosure</em>. It averages 10 ft. in height, and is well and very
    substantially built. On this side, at 32 ft. from the eastern end, is a
    drain leading from <em>No. 15 Enclosure</em>.</p>

  <p>The western entrance to this passage has on the north-eastern side a
    rounded buttress 5 ft. high, 6 ft. long, and protruding 1 ft. 10 in.
    from the face of the wall. This buttress has a portcullis groove, but
    this has recently been built up in order to strengthen the buttress.
    On the opposite side there are traces only of a corresponding buttress
    in the shape of some foundation stones, and there are also signs that
    there were once steps extending from buttress to buttress.</p>

  <p>It is probable that the ancient floor was only a few inches below the
    present cleared-out floor, as what appear to be paving stones, together
    with small sections of granite floor, can be seen outcropping at
    several points along the passage, but vine and tree roots have lifted
    the rest of the stones out of place.</p>

  <p>At the eastern end is a large, substantial, and well-constructed
    rounded buttress protruding 9 ft. towards south-west from the
    north-eastern side of the passage, where it here opens on to <em>No. 14
    Enclosure</em>. This buttress gives the passage-way a turn south at almost
    right angles. This <span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>buttress is from 4 ft. to 10 ft. in height on its
    front face, but 21 ft. at its rear, and this buttress forms part of the
    boundary of <em>No. 14 Enclosure</em>.</p>

  </div>

  <p>It is possible that this buttress which is hollow, and to which there
    are traces of an entrance from the passage, once enclosed steps leading
    on to the summit of the wall between the <em>Parallel Passage</em> and the
    <em>Inner Parallel Passage</em>.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Certainly the way the stone débris inside
    the buttress has fallen tends to support this conjecture.</p>

  <h3>SOUTH PASSAGE</h3>

  <p>This passage appears to have been the main artery leading from the main
    and <em>North Entrance</em> of the temple right into the central portion of
    the building, where it has its terminus. It is 68 ft. long from the
    broad step on the south side of the <em>North Entrance</em> to the steps at
    the south end of the passage.</p>

  <p>For 23 ft. from the north end where is the broad step there is an
    almost triangular area, 23 ft. from north to south, and 30 ft. from
    east to west, having its base on the north side. The western end of
    <em>Inner Parallel Passage</em> enters it at the eastern corner, and the
    entrance from <em>No. 3 Enclosure</em> is at its western corner. The heights
    of the walls forming this area are: north side being the south wall of
    the <em>Parallel Passage</em>, 15 ft.; south-west side being the north-east
    wall of <em>No. 1 Enclosure</em>, 12 ft.; the west side being the divisional
    wall between the area and <em>No. 3 Enclosure</em>, 6 ft.; the east and south
    being the wall dividing the area from <em>No. 15 Enclosure</em>, 12 ft. All
    these walls are well built and are very substantial.</p>

  <p>In the centre of this area is a raised platform, commencing at 9 ft.
    from the north side of the area and terminating at 21 ft. from the same
    point, thus giving it a length of 12 ft. It is 9 ft. 6 in. wide and 3
    ft. high, and has granite cement covering, where not broken, the whole
    summit. An old <span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
    euphorbia tree was found growing out of this cement, its roots having
    played havoc with the side walls of the platform, the best portion now
    remaining facing the north-east side. The tree has now been removed.
    This platform is approached by three large granite cement steps, the
    two lower ones still being in a fair condition. These steps are each 12
    in. high, and from front to back are from 10 in. to 12 in., while they
    are 2 ft. 6 in. wide, and are rounded on the edges.</p>

  <p>The most peculiar circumstance about this platform is that under a
    foot depth of vegetable mould which completely covered it and rendered
    the platform shapeless, and lying on the surface of the cement floor,
    were found some hundred-weights of bones of oxen. There were no bones
    other than those of oxen, and the bones had not been split open for the
    marrow, as is so frequently found to be the case in very old Makalanga
    débris heaps. Nor were any broken pottery, iron implements, or iron and
    brass bangles, such as are most usually found together in such débris,
    to be seen, but carbonised wood was found in large quantities.</p>

  <p>It should be remembered that Mauch and others of the early writers on
    Zimbabwe state that they had witnessed sacrifices by the Makalanga of
    those days of black oxen in the <em>Elliptical Temple</em>, and the local
    natives also state that this was their practice up to within the last
    fifteen years. Possibly this was the spot where these sacrifices took
    place, for though Thomas Baines in a painting he made of one of these
    ceremonies places the <em>Conical Tower</em> in the background, there are no
    signs anywhere near that structure that such sacrifices ever took place
    in its immediate vicinity, all of which has now been cleared of débris
    down to the cement floor at every point where the <em>Conical Tower</em> could
    possibly have formed a background for such a ceremony. It is now almost
    certain that Baines painted this and other pictures of Zimbabwe from
    the descriptions given him by Renders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span> Phillips, and Mauch. But in the
    south-western end of the <em>Parallel Passage</em> for about 20 ft. or 30 ft.
    from its exit into the <em>Sacred Enclosure</em> (<em>east</em>) the débris was very
    mixed, and included bones of oxen and buck, the larger bones all split
    open. Probably this was one of the spots in the temple where these
    annual sacrifices of black oxen by Makalangas took place.</p>

  <p>The platform faces the north, the steps being on the south-east side.
    The area containing this platform was evidently once laid with granite
    cement, but sections of it only remain in the western corner and on its
    north-east side. A drain-hole leading into the <em>Parallel Passage</em> is at
    6 ft. east of the broad steps ascending from this area to the <em>North
    Entrance</em>. This step is 11 ft. broad.</p>

  <p>At 23 ft. south from its north end the area narrows to 3 ft. 10
    in., which width is maintained for 18 ft., the passage for this
    length running between <em>No. 16 Enclosure</em> on the east side and <em>No.
    1 Enclosure</em> on its west side. At this point in this section of the
    passage a large flat slab of granite has been banked up with stones to
    keep the upper portion of the wall on the west from collapsing into the
    passage. The walls here on either side are from 7 ft. to 10 ft. high.</p>

  <p>At 43 ft. south from the north end of the passage are two entrances,
    the one from the west being from <em>No. 1 Enclosure</em>, and this is
    angular, while the other facing it on the east being from a short
    passage on the south side of <em>No. 16 Enclosure</em>, is rounded, and has
    portcullis grooves. From the 43-ft. point the width of the passage is
    2 ft. 8 in., but at its southern extremity it is increased during the
    last few feet to 4 ft. 10 in. The side walls are very well built, and
    are still in a good state of preservation. The entrance at the south
    end of the passage has a rounded buttress with portcullis groove on
    either side leaving a width of 3 ft. This entrance has five large stone
    steps practically perfect. The buttresses are 5 ft. high.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span></p>

  <h3>WEST PASSAGE</h3>

  <p>This passage lies on the west side of the interior of the temple, and
    is between <em>Nos. 4 and 5 Enclosures</em> on the west and <em>No. 1 Enclosure</em>
    and <em>Central Area</em> on the east. It runs north and south, and is formed
    on the west side by a massive and well-built wall, which is in the form
    of an arc; the length of the inside face of the wall being 65 ft., and
    that of the line drawn from extremity to extremity of the wall being 57
    ft., and this passes at 8 ft. from the inner face at the centre of the
    curve westwards.</p>

  <p>This large curved wall is independent of any other structure, and
    stands entirely by itself. It is clearly the best-constructed wall in
    the western half of the temple, and the excellent workmanship displayed
    in the regularity of the courses, the bold and well-executed curve, and
    its immense width, at once strike the attention of anyone who enters
    the temple at the western portal. Its width is 8 ft. at 6 ft. above the
    ground, and its height ranges from 6 ft. to 10 ft.</p>

  <p>The position and character of this wall induced Bent to conjecture that
    this arc was one of the proofs that the entire temple was a “multiform
    temple,” such as are found in South-West Asia, and these “little
    temples ... were dedicated to the cult of particular stars.” Bent
    considered that the massive and well-built curved walls in <em>Enclosures
    Nos. 7 and 15</em> were also employed for particular observations
    independently of the great temple itself. At the time Bent made this
    conjecture he was unaware that up against the centre of the inner face
    of this curved wall was a platform raised some 4 ft. above the level
    of the ground, and of the numerous relics of the older type found at
    and near it, or that there were originally three granite monoliths once
    standing parallel with, and at equal distance from, the west face of
    this wall. These discoveries have only just recently been made, as well
    as other corresponding discoveries in the other two enclosures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span> which
    Bent took to be minor temples. Each of the monoliths is 29 ft. from the
    west face of the wall, and each is 9 ft. apart.</p>

  <p>At its south end the passage is 10 ft. wide, at the north end it
    narrows to 4 ft., but at its centre it averages a width of 10 ft. to 12 ft.</p>

  <p>The east side of the passage is formed for 49 ft. from the north end
    by the wall of <em>No. 1 Enclosure</em>, which here appears to be of poorer
    and later construction, also by a roughly built wall, 11 ft. long,
    with foundation some 4 ft. above the foundation of the wall of <em>No. 1
    Enclosure</em>, and by a rounded buttress, 12 ft. length of facing and 7
    ft. high, which has its foundation on the platform which overlooks the
    west curved wall.</p>

  <p>The platform, which is of cement, once had retaining walls at two
    levels, and portions of these still remain.</p>

  <h3>NORTH-EAST PASSAGE<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></h3>

  <p>This passage is on the north-east side of the temple and immediately
    outside the <em>North Entrance</em>, running north-east at right angles from
    the main wall between that entrance and [590 ft.]. Its total length
    is 360 ft., but there is some evidence that it once extended further
    towards the north-east for at least some hundred yards beyond the 360
    ft. Only a portion of the 360 ft. length has at present been cleared of
    débris.</p>

  <p>On the north-west side it is bounded by a well-built wall 4 ft. 6 in.
    high and 12 ft. long, at the north-east end of which is a large rounded
    buttress with portcullis groove. This buttress projects 3 ft. into the
    passage, and is 3 ft. 6 in. high. Probably another buttress containing
    a corresponding portcullis groove faced it on the opposite side of the
    passage.</p>

  <p>The eastern side is bounded by the entrance to the <em>Outer Parallel
      Passage</em> and by the north wall of that passage, which curves round in
    front of the <em>North Entrance</em> to the temple, and runs at right angles
    to its former position. This <span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>wall, which is well built, is 7 ft. high,
    and forms the east side of the passage for some 35 ft., but at this
    point it is reduced to 3 ft. in height, and is carried on toward the
    north-east in a less carefully constructed style.</p>

  <p>The widths of the passage and the heights of the side walls, measuring
    from the <em>North Entrance</em> to the temple, are as follows:—</p>

  <p>Between 35 ft. and 50 ft. are remains of pavement.</p>

  <p>This passage, with its length of 660 ft., is believed to have formed
    the chief line of communication between the <em>Elliptical Temple</em> and the
    <em>Acropolis</em>, seeing that it runs from the main entrance of the temple
    down into the valley at a point almost facing the lowest extremity of
    the <em>South-East Ancient Ascent</em> to the <em>Acropolis</em>.</p>

  <h3>OUTER PARALLEL PASSAGE</h3>

  <p>On leaving the temple by the <em>North Entrance</em> one enters a walled-in
    area. This area is formed by the southern extremity of the <em>North-East
    Passage</em> and the western extremity of the <em>Outer Parallel Passage</em>,
    both of which meet at, and converge upon, the <em>North Entrance</em>.</p>

  <p>The <em>Outer Parallel Passage</em> runs for 125 ft. east-south-east from
    the <em>North Entrance</em> parallel with the north-east wall of the temple
    between the points [450 ft.] and [575 ft.] of its outer circumference.
    At its extremity near the <em>North Entrance</em> this passage is 7 ft. wide,
    and 25 ft. further east-south-east of the entrance it is 3 ft. 8 in.
    wide, which width is maintained for a length of 50 ft., beyond which
    point it commences to widen out till the east-south-east extremity is
    reached, where it is 12 ft. 6 in. wide.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

  <p>Opposite the <em>North Entrance</em> the outer wall of the passage is 6 ft.
    high; at 25 ft. further east-south-east, 5 ft.; at 75 ft., 8 ft.;
    at 100 ft., 7 ft.; and at 125 ft., 5 ft., the line of summit from
    the 25 ft. point to the east-south-east extremity being fairly level
    throughout. This outer wall is well built. It is 4 ft. 2 in. wide on
    the summit at 5 ft. from the floor of the passage, and 3 ft. 10 in.
    wide at 7 ft. from the ground.</p>

  <p>At 25 ft. from the <em>North Entrance</em> is a rounded entrance through the
    outer wall. This has portcullis grooves. It is 1 ft. 10 in. wide, and
    has three steps formed of the courses of the foundation of the wall,
    the upper step being curved back into the entrance.</p>

  <p>At the extremity near the <em>North Entrance</em> there are the remains of a
    small rounded buttress projecting into the passage from the main wall
    of the temple.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">South-East Ancient Ascent—Lower Parapet—Rock Passage—Upper

  <p class="drop-cap">ON Zimbabwe Hill, at a height of some 230 ft. to 250 ft. above the
    valley which runs along its west and south sides, stands the Acropolis
    or Hill Fortress. Its prominent and strategic position on this
    precipitous and practically isolated granite kopje gives it a grandly
    imposing appearance among the many large ruins included within the
    Zimbabwe Reserve.</p>

  <p>Viewing the hill from the valley, one can well realise that Nature
    alone made the place impregnable, while the builders of almost four
    thousand years ago applied their highly developed engineering skill and
    ingenuity to make the stronghold even more absolutely unassailable.</p>

  <p>The south side of the hill is defended by a precipice some 90 ft.
    high, running without break from the western end for over 300 yds.
    to the eastern side of the hill, where the precipice loses itself in
    gigantic boulders, each of many hundred tons weight, which, owing to
    their beetling form, render that side of the hill inaccessible. Great
    boulders form the summit of the hill, and are in a cliff-shaped line
    running from west to east. Several of the highest boulders appear to
    be most delicately poised on the edges of the shoulders of gigantic
    cliffs, and these rise up at least 50 ft. to 70 ft. above the highest
    portion of the Hill Ruins, thus <span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>making the total height of the kopje
    to be slightly more than 320 ft.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_276">
    <img src="images/i_276.jpg" width="600" height="411" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">ZIMBABWE HILL</div>
    <div class="subcaption">VIEW FROM HAVILAH CAMP</div>
  </div>

  <p>The bases of the southern walls are built on the outward slope of the
    brink of the line of steep granite cliff, the lowest row of stones
    being deep at their front and narrow at the back. So markedly are these
    wedge-shaped rows of stones laid over the brink of the precipice that
    at first sight one hardly notices where the wall ends and the precipice
    begins, especially as the blocks in the walls present in the dry season
    the same colourings and tints as the line of cliff itself. Below the
    precipice the ground has a very sharp fall of some 70 ft. into the
    valley.</p>

  <p>The feelings provoked in one’s mind on visiting the Elliptical Temple
    and Sacred Cone, which are in the valley, are those of awe and
    reverence; but on inspecting the Acropolis the visitor is overcome
    by a sense of absolute amazement and sheer bewilderment, which are
    intensified at every step taken along its numerous labyrinthine
    passages on climbing the hill.</p>

  <p>Above the precipice, as seen from the valley, are massive walls, on
    the summits of which some dozen monoliths, more or less erect, are
    still to be seen standing clear against the sky-line. From this point
    of view alone—and this but represents a small fraction of the walls of
    which these ruins are composed—one realises that many thousands of tons
    of granite blocks (those in the outer faces having been squared and
    dressed) have been transported up the precipitous kopje to a height of
    no less than 230 ft., for examination of the rocks on the hill proves
    that the greater quantity of stone used in the walls was not quarried
    on the kopje itself.</p>

  <p>Apart from the infinite patience and painstaking toil of the ancients
    as displayed in their careful and correct building and complicated plan
    and style of architecture, this one fact of so much stone quarried
    and dressed elsewhere and carried up to such a height as a man could
    hardly climb who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span> bore no burden, is one to amaze and perplex even the
    most casual and indifferent visitor. Later, on reaching the ruins it
    will be seen that very many thousand tons of granite blocks have been
    carried up the hill. This fact serves to still further accentuate the
    statements made by the authors on pages 60 and 65 of <cite>Ancient Ruins
    of Rhodesia</cite> that (1) not only did the ancients of the first period
    of Zimbabwe architecture realise that they were occupying a hostile
    country, but (2) the ancient builders had at their disposal slave
    labour to an enormous and incalculable extent, and this apart from the
    overwhelming evidences pointing to the same conclusion presented by the
    thousands of ancient workings spread over Southern Rhodesia, and the
    hundreds of massive fortresses and temples occupying a corresponding
    area.</p>

  <p>These and many other obvious suggestions present themselves most
    forcibly at even the partial view of the Hill Fortress as seen from the
    valley.</p>

  <p>The first question occurring to one ascending the hill is: Where is
    the ancient ascent? It is obvious that the path used by visitors could
    not be the ascent of the ancients, for were it not for the gaps in the
    walls, access to the summit by the ordinary path would be absolutely
    impracticable. Indeed, the ordinary path runs at several points along
    the reduced tops of broken walls, and crosses the foundations of some
    dozen outer defence walls, which are now practically demolished and
    barely traceable.</p>

  <p>There are two well-defined ancient approaches to the summit of the
    Acropolis, one being on the south side of the hill and the other on the
    face fronting the west-north-west. It is believed that at least two
    other ancient ascents exist. The N.N.W. ascent has not been completely
    cleared out, though it is very well defined, and some 320 ft. of its
    940 ft. length can now be traversed by the visitor, but the south-east
    ascent has recently been cleared out of large trees, shrubs, and many
    tons of wall débris and silted soil, so that it is now <span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>possible for
    visitors to use it with ease. Mogabe, the Zimbabwe Makalanga chief, now
    seventy years of age, who at one time had his kraal on the northern
    side of the summit of Zimbabwe Hill, as well as the older of his
    headmen, all state they had never before seen this ancient ascent so
    cleared out. They say that the late Chipfuno’s people, and subsequently
    their own, used it as an approach to the kraal, but not generally,
    and this was only possible by climbing along the tops of the walls
    and over the large wall-débris heaps that blocked up the passage-way.
    Certainly for at least one hundred years this ascent could not have
    been used, for the débris piles were covered with lichens, and had
    every appearance of great age. The Makalanga had also purposely blocked
    up the passage with a substantial wall, which was erected in Chipfuno’s
    time. Some of the trees cleared from the passages proved by their size
    that they had stood there long before the Chartered Company’s advent
    into the country.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow600" id="i_278">

    <div class="caption">ACROPOLIS RUINS<br />Zimbabwe</div>
  </div>

  <p>In fact, the ascent by this ancient approach now occupies a little
    more than half the time required to walk round by the circuitous path
    till recently used by visitors, besides affording to the climber a
    revelation as to the ingenuity and wonderful engineering skill of the
    ancients in effecting the defence of the hill. Unless this ancient
    approach be traversed by the visitor, one of the principal features
    provided by the Acropolis or Hill Ruins will have been missed.</p>

  <h3>SOUTH-EAST ANCIENT ASCENT</h3>

  <p>Leaving the huts at Havilah Camp, which occupy a low granite knoll on
    the north side of the Shangani Grave and overlook the narrow valley
    running at the south foot of the hill, one crosses the outspan and
    passes through the “Outspan Ruins,”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> which face the camp at a
    distance of 70 yds. due north, which ruins are part of an inner line
    of defence wall running round the base of the hill on the west, south,
    and east sides, and which lie within the main outer wall sweep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>ing
    round from the west side of the Elliptical Temple to the north side
    of Zimbabwe Hill, enclosing the large water-holes believed to have
    been made by the ancients. From the ascent facing the camp a newly-cut
    path leads in a direct line up some 70 ft. higher towards the ancient
    approach, but with a slight trend to the east.</p>

  <p>Before striking the walls of the passage-way, the path crosses at
    right angles the foundations of some seven or eight outer defence
    walls and walls of terraces and buried enclosures all rising in tiers
    one above and at the back of the other. The soil here is black with
    ash débris, and in cutting the rough steps in the path to the ascent,
    each shovelful of this black soil contained a large quantity of broken
    pottery and bones of animals. This débris on being examined shows
    most evidently that it is not ancient; further, it is pronounced by
    local natives to have been thrown out from the ruins above by previous
    generations of Makalanga, but not by the mediæval Makalanga, who,
    according to Portuguese records (1560 to 1750), occupied these ruins
    as one of the courts or chief residences of the succession of dynastic
    chiefs, each known as the Monomotapa or “The Lord of the Mines.” This
    débris is believed to cover that of the mediæval Makalanga and of the
    ancients, for all débris would by the formation of the cliff above
    be guided to this part of the lower southern slope, and the heavy
    downfalls of very many rainy seasons would distribute it over the steep
    face of the southern slope, and spread it into the valley, where any
    quantity of such débris may be found.</p>

  <p>The path from the camp strikes the ancient ascent at 70 ft. above
    the valley. The length of the approach, measured in the centre of
    the passage in all its turnings, is 349 ft. from this point to its
    termination on the summit of the precipice. It extends in a westerly
    direction from the 70 ft. to the 210 ft. level on the hill. This
    passage can be traced downwards into the valley to clear of the end of
    the kopje for 420 yds.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

  <p>The ascent is, for an ancient ruin, in a remarkably good state of
    preservation, except at a few points where whole lengths of walls have
    fallen into the narrow passage which runs between high walls. All this
    wall débris, which effectively blocked the passage, has just recently
    been removed. At one point the end of a wall had collapsed bodily into
    the passage, and being on higher ground had filled it up to the height
    of the walls below, but this débris has also been cleared away, so that
    visitors can now walk without the slightest hindrance up the ascent on
    practically what was the ancient flooring, and ascend the old flights
    of steps. To such an extent had the passage become choked up that it
    required some fifteen native labourers, working at different points,
    no less than four days to cut away sufficient growth as would enable
    a mere scramble to be made over the débris in the passages, while the
    thorough clearing away of wall débris occupied the whole gang for
    nearly a fortnight. Now that this ancient ascent has been made an easy
    approach, this passage to the summit of Zimbabwe Hill has become the
    most popular ascent.</p>

  <p>The chief architectural features represented in the ascent are the
    (<i>a</i>) Lower Parapet, (<i>b</i>) the Rock Passage, and (<i>c</i>) the Upper
    Parapet, as also the flights of steps occurring in several lengths.</p>

  <p>The point where the path from the camp strikes this ancient ascent is
    not its most easterly extremity nor its lowest point, for, as before
    stated, this passage can be traced for 420 yds. further east, where
    its emergence into the valley is protected by one, if not two, large
    fort-like ruins of some importance.</p>

  <p>On turning into the ascent from the camp path, an outer wall on the
    left-hand side runs for 42 ft. 6 in., and this wall is now only about
    2 ft. high. The foundations are 4 ft. wide. The upper courses of
    this wall are not ancient, though the foundations and lower courses
    undoubtedly are, for it is evident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span> that blocks which have fallen from
    terrace walls overlooking the passage into the ascent have been laid
    neatly, probably by mediæval Makalanga, on the tops of the wall which
    had already become ruined. The right-hand side of the ascent from this
    point, for a length of 65 ft., is formed by huge boulders. The passage
    throughout this length is 3 ft. 6 in. to 4 ft. wide.</p>

  <h3>(<i>a</i>) THE LOWER PARAPET</h3>

  <p>At the upper end of this 45 ft. length of wall, and on the left-hand
    side, is a natural parapet artificially improved. This is the Lower
    Parapet, the outer and left-hand side of which is formed by the summit
    of a large boulder 25 ft. long, and its highest point not more than
    4 ft. 6 in. above the floor of the ascent. From this vantage ground
    a fine view is obtained of the hills to the south, with the Bentberg
    (<i>Matusa</i>) directly opposite, and the Elliptical Temple and the valley
    of Ruins below.</p>

  <p>On the inner and right-hand side of the Lower Parapet the rock glacis
    is surmounted by two terrace walls, really enclosures filled in, the
    second being behind and higher than the first. The lower terrace wall
    has a frontage to the south of 24 ft., and the upper terrace wall
    starts at 14 ft. to the rear of the top of the lower wall. Portions
    of the higher wall are still intact, and judging by the line of wall
    débris, it had a frontage to the south of some 20 ft.</p>

  <p>Facing the passage at the west end of the Lower Parapet is a wall 3
    ft. 6 in. high, running north for 12 ft. The top of this wall is 4
    ft. wide, and is built upon a large granite boulder, which beetles
    considerably at the outer and southern extremity of this wall. The
    northern end of the wall is wedge-shaped, the point being well made
    with finely tapering sides. A similar wedged-shaped buttress is to be
    seen at the entrance to the Upper Parapet, and also on the south side
    of the east entrance in the interior of the Eastern Temple on Zimbabwe
    Hill.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span></p>

  <p>The wall thus described acts as a division or parting of the ways, as
    in the case of the wedge-shaped end of the wall at the Upper Parapet,
    and a short passage 4 ft. wide and 12 ft. long runs along the west face
    of the wall to the brink of the boulder which beetles to a steep drop
    below.</p>

  <p>The object of this short passage jutting out from the main ascent to
    the brink of the boulder’s edge is inexplicable, unless it was intended
    as a débris shoot, for at the base of the south front of this boulder,
    and some 20 ft. below, is a large débris pile of past and present
    Makalanga ashes, pottery, and bones of animals. This is contained in
    a loose black soil, but the débris of the ancients underlying the
    obviously Makalanga débris is contained in a light yellow soil the
    surface of which has become almost as hard as cement. The examination
    of this lower stratum of débris fully confirms the suggestion that this
    short passage which terminates, so to speak, in space was one of the
    spots where the ancients shot their débris.</p>

  <p>At the north end of this short side-passage the main ascent takes a
    long curve for 51 ft. westwards, from south-west to north-west, and is
    formed on the outer side by a wall 5 ft. to 6 ft. wide on its present
    reduced summit and from 6 ft. to 9 ft. in height, which runs still
    ascending to the top end of the 51 ft. length. Here the ascent is
    steeper than near the Lower Parapet, and steps, and traces of steps,
    can be seen at several points.</p>

  <p>The inner or cliff side of the ascent, from the Lower Parapet to the
    higher end of the 51 ft. wall on the opposite side, is formed by large
    walls 3 ft. 6 in. wide on their present summits, and averaging 5 ft. in
    height, but are built back on a much higher level of foundation than
    the outer wall of the passage. These inner walls enclose an almost
    square open space on the inner side of the ascent, the area being 16
    ft. on the south-east, 12 ft. on the north-east, and 11 ft. on the
    north, the lower and south-east wall slanting down-hill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span> towards the
    passage, so that the lowest corner of the area is at the point where
    the ascent enters the area. The enclosure is entirely thrown into the
    passage. This lower corner of the area is about 8 ft. north-west of
    the wedge-shape dividing wall just described. The arrangement of the
    walls and of the area, with its lowest point resting on the passage, is
    most patently an intentional design of the ancient military engineers,
    as the slanting-down wall on the south-east side would provide room
    within the area for a hundred defenders, while the narrow passage
    immediately below where the ascent enters the area could barely have
    held two invaders fighting abreast. But this narrow point was once
    much narrower, for the foundations of a projecting buttress, rounded
    into the lowest corner of the area, are to be seen about 2 ft. above
    where the south-east wall slopes down-hill to within 3 ft. of the inner
    face of the outer wall. The foundations of this projecting buttress
    are very indistinct, and probably will disappear, as, now the buttress
    has collapsed, visitors walk across the remaining foundation stones
    as a short cut. The wall débris here suggests that the buttress was a
    high structure. The Zimbabwe Makalanga headmen, who were watching the
    clearing operations, informed the author that this buttress was once a
    high one, but this was in their early days and many years before their
    kraal was removed from Zimbabwe Hill.</p>

  <p>From above the enclosed area to the end of the 51 ft. length of outer
    wall before mentioned the passage on the inner side is bounded by
    a wall which runs parallel to the outer wall in its curve from the
    south-west to the north-west.</p>

  <p>From the higher end of the 51 ft. length of wall the passage turns
    directly west for 43 ft., where it curves to the north-east for 26 ft.,
    averaging a width of 3 ft. 6 in., except just lower than the curve and
    through its continuation where it narrows to 2 ft. The heights of the
    outside wall run from 3 ft. to 4 ft. 6 in. before it reaches the curve.
    On <span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>the inner side wall of the lowest part of this length the wall is
    much broken, especially a length of 11 ft., which once held dentelle
    pattern, facing south.</p>

    <div class="caption">VIEW FROM SOUTH-EAST ASCENT, ACROPOLIS</div>
  </div>

  <p>The end walls or frame of this dentelle pattern are still to be seen,
    and many of the small blocks used in making this pattern were found
    in the passage-way. The blocks can always be identified by their
    exact similarity in size, and also on two faces they are exceedingly
    time-worn, if not decomposed, as they are built up in columns with one
    corner projecting outwards and flush with the face of the wall. This
    pattern has now become completely destroyed by wild vine trees growing
    inside the wall and forcing out its outer face on to the passage floor.
    This damage must have been done within the last ten years.</p>

  <p>This was one of the finest examples of dentelle pattern so far
    discovered in Rhodesia, and had it not been destroyed would have been
    by far the largest pattern of all the five instances. Dentelle pattern
    is one of the many distinguishing features of the first period of
    Zimbabwe architecture.</p>

  <p>On the floor of this passage at this point and upwards there is a
    flight of some thirty or forty steps. Each is very narrow from front
    to back, so much so that it is exceedingly awkward for anyone wearing
    boots to climb or descend them, though the Makalanga with their bare
    feet climb them with the greatest ease. The steps extend from side to
    side of the passage, but their end blocks, which here are very small,
    are not built into the foundations of the side walls as are the large
    steps to be found in the entrances and passages of all the original
    buildings at Zimbabwe. It is therefore believed that these steps in
    the ascent, or at least these particular steps, are not ancient, but
    are laid upon the original steps by mediæval Makalanga, for there is a
    freshness in their appearance which is never seen in steps which are
    undoubtedly ancient. This belief is strengthened considerably when one
    compares the flight of toe-lines with the broad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span> deep, and massive
    steps at several points in the ascent, which were built when the
    foundations of the passage walls were laid.</p>

  <p>At the top end of the curve in this length of passage the heights of
    both walls are 9 ft., with a width of passage at this point of 2 ft. 4
    in. In this curve are traces of several rows of large steps.</p>

  <p>At 12 ft. above the curve the passage turns with a sharp angle to due
    west-north-west. On the north or inner side at this turn is a large
    buttress built up against the face of the cliff. This buttress is 19
    ft. 6 in. in height at its rear and abuts from the cliff for 2 ft. 6
    in. The front of the buttress is only 7 ft. in height. The buttress
    is 19 ft. long, but wall débris fallen from the summit of the cliff
    extends upwards towards the entrance to the Rock Passage for another
    8 ft. The outer wall here averages from 2 ft. 6 in. to 3 ft. 6 in. in
    height. This wall has every appearance of having been reconstructed at
    a later period. Its face is exposed to the fall of every stone from the
    walls on the summit of the precipice, and no wall débris could descend
    without damaging it. Up against its face were piles of blocks which had
    come from above, but some of these piles were comparatively modern.
    This point in the ascent, owing to the formation of the face of the
    cliff, would have guided to it all débris falling from the southern
    wall of the Eastern Temple, some portions of which have fallen into the
    ascent. The passage between the buttress of the outer wall is 2 ft.
    wide, but at the top end of the buttress it widens out to 4 ft. where
    it enters the Rock Passage.</p>

  <h3>(<i>b</i>) THE ROCK PASSAGE</h3>

  <p>From this point the ascent is continued in the same direction between
    the main cliff of the hill on the inner side (which at this elevated
    level of the ascent is only 50 ft. above the passage) and a colossal
    boulder on the outer side. This boulder beetles inwards towards the
    cliff and over the heads <span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>of passers-by. The outside height of the
    boulder appears to be some 80 ft. or 90 ft., and at one time before the
    occupation of the hill by the ancient builders it formed part of the
    main cliff from which it had fallen away for some feet, both outwards
    and downwards; the depression in the face of the cliff from which it
    slipped is still the exact shape of the boulder. In the Rock Passage
    the height of the inside face of the boulder above the artificially
    made raised floor is about 40 ft. to 20 ft., according as the ascent
    rises. The ancients are believed to have filled in the split opening
    between cliff and boulder to the needed height to carry their ascent.
    This practice was a common one with the ancients, and a good instance
    of this work is seen in the Buttress Passage in the Acropolis ruins.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_286a">
    <img src="images/i_286a.jpg" width="437" height="550" alt="" />

    <div class="caption">VIEW DOWN ROCK PASSAGE, SOUTH-EAST ASCENT, ACROPOLIS</div>
  </div>

  <p>Once inside the Rock Passage the path rises rapidly till it reaches
    the open at the 200 ft. level of the hill. The passage is 48 ft.
    long, and its average width is 2 ft. 6 in., but at one point it is
    barely 1 ft. 10 in. wide. Where the boulders end on the higher side a
    wall runs up on the outer side for 8 ft., and this is 4 ft. to 1 ft.
    higher, lessening as the path ascends. The cliff here still forms the
    inner side for this distance, and at the top end is a rounded buttress
    jutting out from the cliff for 3 ft., and below it, and on the south
    side, are several well-defined large steps of the undoubtedly ancient
    type ascending on the outer side of the buttress for 12 ft.</p>

  <p>At the end of this 12 ft. length the passage turns north and north-east
    for 21 ft., and passes on the west side of the wedge-shaped-ended
    wall, which forms the division where the path to the Higher Parapet
    leaves the ascent. At the end of the 21 ft. length the walls of the
    ascent appear to terminate, but the path to the Western Temple and to
    the other ruins on the hill is continued through a gap made recently,
    for the sake of visitors, in a Makalanga-built wall erected on ancient
    foundations. This reconstruction of the wall by Makalanga without
    leaving any entrance down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>wards to the ascent deliberately blocked it
    up. This bears out the Zimbabwe headmen’s statement that within the
    last fifty years they rarely used the ancient ascent in climbing up to
    their kraal on the summit of the hill. Passing through the gap in the
    Makalanga wall one enters the Western Enclosure, which lies at the foot
    of the west face of the west wall of the Western Temple.</p>

  <p>But the description so far given of the ascent is incomplete, for on
    the east side of the wedge-shaped buttress, which is on the west side
    of the Rock Passage, is a passage to the Western Temple by the Higher
    Parapet.</p>

  <h3>(<i>c</i>) THE HIGHER PARAPET</h3>

  <p>The length of this parapet, which extends from within 9 ft. 6 in. of
    the summit of the ancient ascent, is 78 ft., and it runs in an easterly
    direction from the right-hand side of the ascent at the point where is
    the upper wedge-shaped buttress and the outer parapet wall is built
    along a narrow ledge at the very utmost edge of the cliff. Its front
    foundation stones are wedge-shaped to suit the declivity of the rock
    on which they are placed. At certain points this parapet wall has
    fallen over the brink into the Rock Passage below, but the foundations
    remain. This dilapidation is more apparent at the eastern end of
    the parapet, where it passes on the precipice side of the face of a
    projecting boulder and also of a rounded buttress 7 ft. high, which
    is very well built. The boulder is erected up against the bottom part
    of the rounded end of the main west wall of the Western Temple on its
    southern extremity. This rounded buttress is 4 ft. west of the point
    where the Higher Parapet joins the Parallel Passage, which is a still
    more easterly and more elevated extension of the ancient ascent to the
    Western Temple.</p>

  <p>Coming up the ascent, and 9 ft. 6 in. from its summit, the path divides
    as before mentioned at the wedge-shaped buttress, the right-hand path
    being the approach to the Higher Parapet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span> Three feet above this
    wedge-shaped end of wall are clear traces of large steps, and at this
    point and on the right-hand side is a portion of dentelle pattern
    introduced into the wall, and this faces due west. This pattern
    originally consisted of five columns of blocks with projecting edges,
    but the lower portions of four columns now only remain. The blocks are
    in five courses. Unlike the dentelle blocks lower in the ascent, and
    also the blocks in this pattern on the Platform of the Western Temple,
    these blocks are of the ordinary size used in building the walls, and
    in size resemble the blocks used in this pattern on the east main wall
    of the Eastern Temple, and also those in this pattern on the Conical
    Tower in the Elliptical Temple.</p>

  <p>The highest part of the outer wall of the Higher Parapet is now only 2
    ft. 6 in., with a similar width on the top. The width of the approach
    to this parapet from the wedge-shaped end of the dividing wall is 2 ft.
    on the floor. The wall on the inner side of the parapet at its western
    end is 4 ft. 6 in. to 6 ft. high, and rounds off to the south to the
    wedge-shaped end where it terminates.</p>

  <p>Visitors should refrain from passing along the Higher Parapet unless
    they are perfectly certain no one is in the Rock Passage at the time,
    as any block put in motion even by the careful climber must fall
    into the passage below. As before stated, the parapet wall is very
    dilapidated and blocks might fall at the slightest movement near them.
    But even with this caution the Higher Parapet is not a safe place
    for visitors, for, as can be seen from below, the foundations of the
    parapet, which are built over the brink of the precipice, show a
    bulging out which must sooner or later effect the destruction of the
    parapet.</p>

  <p>The Higher Parapet would enable the ancient defenders to effectually
    block the approach of any enemy through the Rock Passage, however great
    their number.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span></p>

  <p>There are two points worthy of notice in connection with this ancient ascent:—-</p>

  <p>1. <i>Original heights of walls.</i>—The walls of the ascent in their
    original state were considerably higher than even the highest (9 ft.)
    as seen at two points to-day. In discussing this matter with some of
    the Makalanga headmen, it was ascertained that even within their day,
    say fifty years—for Mogabe is fully seventy years of age—some of the
    highest walls were 4 ft. or 5 ft. higher than they are at present. But
    on examining the numerous and immense wall-débris piles which were
    removed in August, 1902, the estimate as to the heights of the walls in
    their original form has to be very considerably increased, for these
    piles were only the débris of the inner side walls and of the inner
    faces of the outer walls, since the main portions of the outer walls
    which have fallen have gone down the precipice, for at its base one can
    walk for over 100 yds. on wide and high piles of wall débris which has
    fallen down from the outer walls of the ascent.</p>

  <p>The present widths of the walls also are some guide in forming an
    estimate of their original heights. Some of these walls are from 5 ft.
    to 7 ft. wide on their present very reduced summits, and taking the
    usual Zimbabwe batter-back of 1 ft. in 6 ft. which is found in many of
    the buildings of the first period of Zimbabwe architecture—and these
    buildings are most manifestly of that period—it would be within a safe
    limit were it stated that these passage walls were at least 15 ft.
    high on either side throughout the greater length of the ascent. This
    estimate would then fairly account for the great amount of wall débris
    with which whole lengths of the ascent were completely choked up, in
    some places to the tops of the walls on either side, and also for the
    wall débris at the foot of the ascent.</p>

  <p>Certainly most of the damage to the walls was done centuries ago, for
    the ancient blocks on the sides and tops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span> of the débris piles have,
    since they fell into their present position on the piles, become on
    all their exposed faces and sides, and even on their back parts, as
    weathered and time-eaten, and in some cases as decomposed, as the front
    faces of the blocks remaining in the walls.</p>

  <p>But, unfortunately, irreparable damage has been done to these walls
    within the last twenty years, and certainly within the last ten years,
    for trees of not older growths than these periods were found to be
    growing right in the centres of the walls, their roots pushing out
    lengths of wall faces. This is the cause of the destruction of the
    lower set of dentelle pattern, which has certainly been effected during
    the last ten years. The inside of the wall from which the dentelle
    blocks have fallen has every appearance of being quite fresh, and is
    not in the slightest degree weather or time-worn.</p>

  <p>2. <i>The ascent from the coast route.</i>—This ancient ascent being on
    the south side of the hill, and running for 600 yds. from the valley
    at the clear east end of the hill up the south face to the summit,
    it may naturally be taken for granted that this was the path along
    which all arrivals by the route from the coast at or near Sofala would
    approach Zimbabwe Fortress. As there are only two ancient ascents, the
    southern and the north-western, and all other parts of the hill being
    inaccessible, this conjecture may probably be the correct one, for to
    have traversed the North-Western Passage for such a purpose would have
    taken the ancients at least one mile out of their way. Every step taken
    down the Southern Passage was one taken nearer to the coast.</p>

  <p>On referring to <cite>The Ancient Ruins of Rhodesia</cite>, it will be found
    that chains of ruins of forts, occupying strategic positions at
    comparatively equal distances from each other, run in a south-easterly
    direction along the Motelekwe River, and are further carried along the
    Sabi far into Portuguese South-East Africa. The south ascent appears
    to be the north-west termination of this line from the coast, and
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span> importance of this approach is demonstrated by the presence of
    two outer distinct and large ruins in the valley at the south-eastern
    end of the hill, and these guard the lowest extremity of the ascent.
    The Mapaku Ruins, misnamed Little Zimbabwe, which lie eight miles
    south-east of the Great Zimbabwe, would form the first posting station
    and fort for the protection of the road to the Motelekwe chain of forts.</p>

  <p>Besides, the contour of the country round Zimbabwe very clearly points
    this route out as the ancient line of road to the south-east coast,
    any other line, as can be seen from the summit of Zimbabwe Hill, being
    barred by ranges of steep and high kopjes, in addition to which it may
    be observed that the wagon road from Zimbabwe towards the Motelekwe and
    Sabi rivers runs to-day along this identical line, as the formation of
    the land permits of no other route from Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p>It was shown in chapter vii. that discoveries demonstrated that the
    ancients exported a large quantity of the gold won from the thousands
    of ancient workings on the numerous gold-belts of Southern Rhodesia.
    This amount authorities have placed, on a conservative estimate, at no
    less than £75,000,000. Most probably a portion of whatever gold was won
    in the northern gold districts of Southern Rhodesia went to the coast
    by a northern route and not <i>viâ</i> Zimbabwe. But the gold collected from
    each of the capital towns in the more southern portion of Southern
    Rhodesia, the capital towns having collected the gold from their
    respective sub-districts on the reefs, would come to the metropolitan
    centre at Zimbabwe, ready for transmission by caravan to the coast.
    The districts that in all probability sent from their capital towns
    their stores of gold as they became accumulated, so far as the lines
    of forts and the contiguity, geographical position, and convenience
    indicate, would be the present Tati, Bulawayo, Bembesi, Selukwe,
    Gwanda, Filabusi, Belingwe, etc., and the gold districts of Southern
    Mashonaland. For the service of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span> these districts the north-west ascent
    at Zimbabwe would appear to be extremely natural. The gold therefore,
    in all probability, was brought from these districts to Zimbabwe
    along its north-west ascent, and was taken away to the coast by the
    marvellously protected path leading to the south-east.</p>

  <p>This argument is not mere romancing. It is one which has every evidence
    in its favour so far as any evidence can at present be secured. Passing
    along the south-eastern ascent we may be pardoned if some poor attempt
    be made to reconstruct some of the scenes that have taken place in
    ancient times within its narrow and tortuous walls. Here may have
    occurred the greeting of fresh arrivals from the coast, or from the
    mother country of the ancient colonists; the bringing of news from a
    far country, possibly news from Yemen, and later from Tyre and Sidon;
    news of changes in home dynasties or of the progress of those ancient
    and classic wars which shook the world and started fresh eras and
    epochs in its history.</p>

  <p>There, too, might have been seen the train of slaves carrying their
    golden burden in claw-hammer-shaped ingots as stated to have been shown
    on the monuments of Punt, and as they are pictured in the tombs of
    ancient Egypt, of which the ancient soapstone moulds are represented
    in collections of relics found in Rhodesia. Ivory, apes, ostrich
    feathers, and gorgeous birds would be borne in the caravan, while gangs
    of slaves, doomed to exile, would follow in the convoy, for all these,
    since before the dawn of history, have been exported to the “Near East”
    from Sofala and ancient Rhodesia.</p>

  <p>Again, there might have been seen the dusky Semitic crowd watching the
    departure of the results of their toil on so many ancient gold-bearing
    districts, dressed in short, armless tunics (p. 108),<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and displaying
    massive gold bangles, exquisitely made and chased with Zimbabwe
    designs, on arms, wrists, legs, and ankles, and with chains of heavy
    gold beads round their necks, and in their hands the rods of office
    with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>the beaten gold sun images on the tops, gold ferules at the ends,
    or copper battle-axes and spearheads thickly plated with gold—for
    all these are articles plentifully found with the buried ancients of
    Rhodesia.</p>

  <p>One can almost see the vantage grounds seized by the younger members
    of the ancient crowd to view such spectacles, for on the same granite
    cliff-ledges, foot-polished by ages of wear, the young men of the
    Makalanga love to climb and squat.</p>

  <p>At the lower end of the passage, and near the two ancient forts which
    protect its south-eastern extremity, would be the soldiery in readiness
    to take up their position in guarding the caravan. One can realise how
    the ancients climbed on to the boulders at the very summit of Zimbabwe
    Hill to strain anxious eyes in watching the progress of the convoy
    down the valley towards the south-east till it disappeared in the blue
    distance of the lower land.</p>

  <p>Romance is most undoubtedly buried on the floors of all Zimbabwe ruins
    throughout Rhodesia, but Romance rivalling that of Rider Haggard at his
    best pervades the massive walls of this ancient ascent as it insinuates
    its upward way along the precipitous side of Zimbabwe Hill.</p>

  <h3>WESTERN ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>To reach the <em>Western Temple</em> on the hill from the <em>South-East Ancient
    Ascent</em>, the <em>Western Enclosure</em> must first be crossed, seeing that the
    <em>Higher Parapet</em> path is now become dangerous.</p>

  <p>This enclosure lies on the west side of the main west wall of the
    <em>Western Temple</em>. The highest part of the enclosure—the east—is 212
    ft., and the lowest—the west part—is 205 ft. above the valley. The main
    west wall of the <em>Western Temple</em> forms its easterly boundary for 71
    ft., the other walls making the enclosure nearly square. The wall on
    the north side is 52 ft. long, 4 ft. to 6 ft. high, and 3 ft. to 4 ft.
    wide on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span> present summit. The west wall is 81 ft. long, and similar in
    width and height. The south side, with no wall now remaining, is 61 ft.
    long, and at 4 ft. to 7 ft. below the south edge, on the outside of
    this enclosure, runs the <em>Higher Parapet</em> previously described.</p>

  <p>None of these enclosing walls, except, of course, the main wall of the
    temple, are ancient. They are rudely built, or, rather, neatly piled.
    This is obviously Makalanga work of a generation or two past, and the
    Zimbabwe Makalanga admit this to be the case. But at several points the
    walls run on ancient foundations. These modern natives, in imitation of
    the monoliths on the temple wall above, have erected a slate monolith
    on their north wall, but upside down. Slate beams, evidently fallen
    from the wall above, have been used by the Makalanga as building
    material, as using them saved labour.</p>

  <p>But there are strong evidences that the builders of the ruins
    themselves used this ground as an enclosure, and these in addition to
    the remains of the enclosing walls’ foundations. At a distance of 15
    ft. in front of the main wall of the temple is a wall built in good
    style and, till recently, perfectly buried in soil. This portion of a
    wall runs from north-east to south-west for 7 ft. 6 in., and is 2 ft. 6
    in. high, ending at each extremity abruptly, the south-west end showing
    a tendency to curve more to the south.</p>

  <p>Also in the north-east corner and at the foot of the main wall of the
    temple, and at 7 ft. and 15 ft. respectively from it, there are very
    decided traces of terrace walls, with parapets descending into the
    interior of the enclosure. The probable purpose of these terraced walls
    is alluded to in the description of the <em>Western Parapet</em>, as this
    parapet runs through other enclosures described later.</p>

  <p>The drop of 7 ft. towards the west in the level of the surface of this
    enclosure rather tends to support the theory advanced by Messrs. Bent
    and Swan that the main west wall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span> of the <em>Western Temple</em> once stood
    some yards more to the west of the present west main wall. This theory
    is at present somewhat difficult to accept, for the existing wall is
    the widest wall yet known in any ruin in Rhodesia, not excepting the
    huge main walls of the <em>Elliptical Temple</em> in the valley. This main
    wall of the <em>Western Temple</em> is 11 ft. wide on its summit at 18 ft.
    above the ground. Still there are other points, mentioned later in
    connection with the <em>Western Temple</em>, which would seem to support
    Messrs. Bent and Swan’s theory.</p>

  <p>Passing from the <em>Ascent</em>, along the south side of this enclosure,
    climbing the wall débris in front, and passing through a gap in the
    dilapidated part of the main wall directly opposite, one enters the
    <em>Western Temple</em> at its south-west corner.</p>

      CHAPTER XV<br /><br />
      <span class="small">THE ACROPOLIS RUINS<br />(<i>Continued</i>)</span>
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="subheadc">The Western Temple</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THIS temple is the most westerly portion of the main ruins on <em>Zimbabwe
    Hill</em>, and is built upon the steep edge of the western side of the
    kopje at 220 ft. above the valley and also immediately on the summit
    of the precipice, some 90 ft. in height, which runs along the south
    face of the hill. A splendid view of the <em>Elliptical Temple</em> in the
    valley, as well as of the many ruins within the <em>Zimbabwe Reserve</em>, is
    obtainable from this point.</p>

  <p>The <em>Western Temple</em> has the form of an amphitheatre, its area being
    in the shape of a little less than a quarter of a circle, the centre
    from which the south and north walls radiate being at its most easterly
    point and 122 ft. from the centre of the inner face of the massive main
    west wall which curves with a magnificently bold and perfect sweep
    towards due west, connects the north and south walls at their westerly
    extremities, and runs for 137 ft. on its inner face from south-west to
    north-west.</p>

  <p>This curved west wall is the most massive structure so far discovered
    in any ancient ruin in Rhodesia, though it is not the longest. It has a
    width of summit at 25 ft. from the ground of 14 ft. 6 in., the general
    average width being 11 ft., and is still liberally decorated with huge
    granite and slate monoliths and a row of small conical towers which are
    now more or less imperfect.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span></p>

  <p>The lengths of the walls along their inner faces are as follows: north
    wall, 90 ft.; south wall, with gaps, 127 ft.; and the curved west wall,
    137 ft.</p>

  <p>The present surface of the area is very irregular owing to the soil and
    wall débris having been piled up at several points by excavators whose
    trenches and digging are still to be seen. Disregarding these piles the
    highest part of the area is at its eastern end, the lowest being at the
    inside base of the west wall.</p>

  <p><em>North wall.</em>—This wall may be divided into several lengths from east
    to north. The 22 ft. length from the east reaches to <em>The Platform
    Cave</em>. This length of wall supports <em>The Platform</em> on its south-west
    side. Here the wall is 12 ft. high, measuring from the present surface
    of the temple, which is, so far as can be ascertained, some 3 ft. to
    5 ft. above the highest and latest ancient floor. Towards the 15 ft.
    point the wall is carried over a huge boulder 11 ft. high, also over a
    smaller boulder partly resting on the first boulder and partly against
    another boulder, which forms part of the north side of <em>The Platform
    Cave</em>, along which boulders the height of the wall is 11 ft. over the
    large boulder, and 6 ft. over the smaller and higher one, but including
    the height of a rounded end of wall on <em>The Platform</em> above which is
    built upon this wall, the height of the wall above the smaller boulder
    is 11 ft.</p>

  <p>The 14 ft. length of this wall clears the entrance to <em>The Platform
    Cave</em> and the steps, now dilapidated, leading from the floor of the
    temple to the upper flight of steps to <em>The Platform</em>. In addition to
    these steps on the west side of the cave, there was once a wall on the
    summit of the boulder up which the steps ran, but the boulder is now
    bare save for a small cap of red <i>daga</i> (clay) which once formed the
    foundation of a small Makalanga granary, such positions being usually
    selected on account of their freedom from white ants.</p>

  <p>The 28 ft. length is built upon and along the top of a long boulder.
    This wall on its inner face is in good condition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span> but its back part
    which forms a portion of the south wall of the <em>Platform Enclosure</em> is
    very dilapidated. The heights of this wall are 7 ft. 6 in., 10 ft., and
    5 ft. at three different points going north-west. The last 7 ft. of
    this length is a gap, the foundations only remaining.</p>

  <p>The 26 ft. length of this wall extends from the gap to the inside of
    the north end of the main west wall, where it acts as the south side
    of the west extremity of the deep passage recently unburied which runs
    down the centre of the <em>Platform Enclosure</em>. It is 5 ft. to 6 ft. high
    on the temple side. This 26 ft. length of wall has been very seriously
    damaged by roots of large trees.</p>

  <p>The widths of the summits of the north wall range between 3 ft. 6
    in. and 5 ft., but as <em>The Platform</em> ends where the west end of <em>The
    Platform</em> comes flush to the temple face of the wall, it is difficult
    to state any width, but still it must be exceptionally wide to carry
    the wall which here rises to 18 ft. from the present filled-in level of
    the centre of the temple.</p>

  <p><em>West wall.</em>—The west wall of the temple runs from north-west to
    south-west, and is 137 ft. long on its inner face, and may, for the
    purposes of this description, be divided into two lengths, <i>i.e.</i>, 29
    ft. and 108 ft. commencing at its north end.</p>

  <p>The 29 ft. length extends from the north end of the west wall to the
    south-west side of a divisional wall of the same height, but only 4 ft.
    wide on its summit, which is built up against the inner face of the
    main west wall and protrudes 9 ft. into the temple in a south-easterly
    direction. This divisional wall has a drain-hole right through it at 6
    ft. below its summit. It is evident that the bottom of the drain, which
    passes through dry masonry, once had a lining of cement which resembles
    in make and quality that used in the lowest floor of the temple. This
    length of the main wall is still intact.</p>

  <p>The 108 ft. length extends from the south-west side of the divisional
    wall just mentioned to the southern extremity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span> the main wall. At 10
    ft. south of this divisional wall is the lowest point in the interior
    of the temple. At 33 ft. along this length, still measuring in a
    southerly direction, the wall has been considerably damaged, there
    being a wide and deep gap on the outer side and a depression in the
    general line of summit of the wall on its inner face. From this point
    in this length to 86 ft. the wall is again intact, and at its original
    height. The last 22 ft. of the 108 ft. length is very considerably
    dilapidated. The west wall terminates on the south-south-west in a
    rounded end, the lower part of which is exceedingly well built and
    stands 11 ft. above the ground. This rounded end is one of the two
    rounded buttresses which form the north or right-hand side of the
    west end of the <em>Parallel Passage</em> on approaching it from the <em>Higher
    Parapet</em>.</p>

  <p>The widths of the west wall at the summit are as follows: north
    extremity, 13 ft. 8 in.; at north end of the 108 ft. length, 14 ft. 6
    in.; at the gap, 2 ft. to 3 ft.; at south-south-west of gap, 12 ft. The
    gap is 23 ft. long on the inner part and 29 ft. long on the outer or
    west side.</p>

  <p>The heights of the wall above the present levels of the ground, outside
    and inside, are as follows: northern extremity, 25 ft. outside, and
    6 ft. inside; at northern extremity of the 108 ft. length, 22 ft.
    outside, and 16 ft. inside; at south-west of gap, 21 ft. outside, and
    10 ft. 6 in. inside. The 22 ft. portion of the 108 ft. length is simply
    a great pile of wall débris. The outside measurements are taken from
    the top of the <em>Western Parapet</em>, which runs along at the foot of the
    west face of the wall.</p>

  <p>There are two points which will make this curved west wall of great
    interest to archæologists:—</p>

  <p>(1) It has the widest summit of any ancient wall yet discovered in
    Rhodesia, and</p>

  <p>(2) The <em>Monoliths</em> and <em>Conical Towers</em> alternating along its summit.
    It should be stated that there are two lengths of summits of this wall
    still remaining intact at their original <span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>heights. One length is at
    the northern end of the wall, and is 44 ft. in length, and the other at
    the south of the gap, and this is 46 ft. in length.</p>

    <div class="caption">SMALL TOWER ON WEST WALL OF WESTERN TEMPLE, ACROPOLIS</div>
  </div>

  <p>On the first line of summit the centres of the towers, foundations,
    or traces, are at the following points, measuring from the northern
    end: 6 ft., north face of tower 2 ft. high only now remains; 12 ft.,
    foundations of tower with débris stones with rounded faces; 18 ft.,
    portion of foundation only; 24 ft., tower in good condition to 2 ft.
    in height; 30 ft., ditto; 36 ft., débris only; and 42 ft., traces of
    foundation and débris.</p>

  <p>On this length of summit there are three slate monoliths with tops,
    some fractured, standing 3 ft. to 5 ft. above the summit of the wall.
    These are practically equi-distant. Two other slate monoliths were
    found in the débris at the outer base of the wall, and judging by the
    spot where found, there are probably two others still buried in the
    débris.</p>

  <p>On the second line of summit, which extends for 46 ft. from south of
    the gap, one round tower remains intact to a height of 3 ft. 6 in.,
    where it has a diameter of 3 ft. 4 in. The towers or traces of towers
    on this line of summit are at the following points, commencing from the
    gap; 4 ft., tower, the most perfect specimen remaining; 10 ft., traces
    of tower; 15 ft., ditto; 20 ft., foundations only; 27 ft., ditto; 33
    ft., traces; 42 ft., ditto.</p>

  <p>On this line of summit there are four slate monoliths, more or less
    erect, standing at equi-distant points. One flat granite monolith
    lies on the wall by the side of the hole in which it once stood. One
    slate monolith was found at the outer base of the wall where the gap
    divides the two lines of summits. The heights of these monoliths, some
    fractured, range from 5 ft. to 9 ft. above the summit of the wall. One
    of these must, in all probability, be 15 ft. long.</p>

  <p>There seems to be little doubt that these towers, as erected
    originally, were conical. The most perfect tower shows a very decided
    drawing-in of the upper courses, while among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span> the débris of each tower
    are smaller blocks, showing by the contracted curve of their rounded
    faces that the courses they represented had much smaller radii than
    those of the courses below.</p>

  <p><i>Architecture and construction of west wall.</i>—Both the architecture
    and construction of this wall are most obviously of the First Zimbabwe
    Period; but most of the material used is of an inferior quality to that
    in the other walls of this temple. This is patent to anyone inspecting
    the western face of the wall, where very many of the granite blocks
    are cracked, and in some places considerably decomposed. Some of the
    courses are also very irregular, and have steep gradients, while
    many courses disappear, or are false in order to restore the level
    of depressed courses, besides which the blocks vary greatly in size.
    Still, the wall does not show any other feature of the Second Period
    Zimbabwe architecture. As stated before, it is undoubtedly the most
    massive wall of any ancient ruin yet discovered in Rhodesia, but it was
    most probably built, or rather reconstructed, during a late portion
    of the First Period, and, as Bent suggests, later than other walls
    of this temple. He further suggests that this is a reconstruction
    of the west wall on a curve some yards further east of its original
    position. In the description of the <em>Western Enclosure</em> (see later),
    of which this wall forms the eastern side, it is stated that there
    is much difficulty in accepting this conjecture. The opportunities
    opened to the author for examining the ground to the west of the wall
    were far better than those opened to Bent, and the failure to discover
    any ancient foundation which could have carried even a much smaller
    wall was complete; in fact, no foundations whatever anywhere within
    the point of distance mentioned by Bent. Moreover, the south end of
    the present wall, as seen at the eastern end of the <em>Higher Parapet</em>,
    is most excellent work, and appears to have been erected at the same
    time as the other walls of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span> temple. Bent’s suggestion as to a
    reconstruction of this wall at a later period is highly probable, but
    this reconstruction was only partial, it did not include the south end,
    and it was upon the original foundations. The radius of the segment of
    the south end demonstrates that the correctness of the curvature of
    this wall would have been destroyed had the reconstructed portion been
    built upon any other line of foundation.</p>

  <p><em>South wall.</em>—This wall is the large massive wall seen from the valley
    on the south and west sides of the hill. It is built upon the actual
    brink of the south precipice, and is 78 ft. long, but including the
    foundations in the gap at its eastern extremity, its total length is
    127 ft.</p>

  <p>The first 21 ft. measuring from the western end forms the outer wall of
    the narrow passage from the <em>Higher Parapet</em> in the <em>South-East Ascent</em>
    to the <em>Western Temple</em>, and also forms the south wall of the western
    end of the <em>Parallel Passage</em>. This wall at its western end is much
    reduced by dilapidation, and here its height rising from the bare rock
    of the precipice is 10 ft. above the floor of the passage. The wall at
    this point terminates in a beautifully rounded end, which is a splendid
    work of art, rivalling in this respect the round end of the wall on
    the south side of <em>Pattern Passage</em>. From the western extremity the
    south wall rises in height on its outer face as it extends east to 25
    ft., and 35 ft. for the rest of the wall as far as the gap. Here the
    original summit is practically intact as far as the west side of the
    gap, where the foundations of the wall are level with the ground and
    are about 8 ft. wide. The inside face of the wall above the interior
    surface of the temple ranges from 11 ft. to 17 ft. according as the
    ground rises and falls.</p>

  <p>There are no traces of round towers on this wall, but three slate
    monoliths and one of granite are still more or less erect on the higher
    portion of the wall. Two slate monoliths were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span> found by the writer
    at the inner base of the wall, and these would have made the line
    equi-distant.</p>

  <p><i>East side of temple.</i>—This is 36 ft. long. The first 10 ft. from the
    south side is a débris heap; from 10 ft. to 26 ft. is a wall rounding
    towards the east, and this wall is 18 ft. 6 in. high; 26 ft. to 29 ft.
    is the <em>Covered Passage</em> where the wall is 9 ft. over the passage; 29
    ft. to 36 ft. is a wall extending to <em>The Platform</em>, where the height
    of the wall is 14 ft. from the lower end of the boulder some 9 ft.
    above the pile of débris lying on the floor. It is at this point that
    the north wall before described commences.</p>

  <p><i>Centre of arc.</i>—Schlichter suggested that the centres of the arcs of
    those massive and decorated walls, which are curved either towards the
    west or east, might have had some peculiar importance in the minds of
    the ancient builders. This suggestion is based on his examination, not
    only of the temples at Zimbabwe, but of the larger elliptical buildings
    elsewhere in the country.</p>

  <p>At the centre of the arc of the curved, decorated, and massively built
    west wall in the <em>Western Temple</em> on the <em>Acropolis</em> (and this is the
    widest wall yet discovered in Rhodesia) a discovery has been made which
    may possibly bear on the question of the orientation of these temples,
    though in the matter of orientation or otherwise it would be much
    safer to keep an open mind till more information can be placed before
    accredited experts acquainted with this branch of science.</p>

  <p>The spot marked R on Bent’s plan—“centre of arc of great wall”—was
    covered on the surface by a very old Makalanga <i>daga</i> floor broken in
    pieces by an old and decayed tree. These loose slabs of clay flooring
    having been removed, about 2 ft. depth of blocks and soil was found.
    The blocks had no relative position to one another, and they were in
    all positions. Immediately below this débris was found a yellow granite
    cement structure. This is semi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>-circular in shape, measuring 11 ft. 8
    in. round the curved base from end to end. The straight back part is 6
    ft. 3 in. across. The structure is formed by two rounded curved rims,
    one on the other, the top one receding 4 in. from the face of the lower
    one. The lower rim is 1 ft. high, and the upper one 8 in. The structure
    is hollow to a depth of 9 in., and the interior extends evenly all
    round to within 10 in. from the front upper face of the structure.</p>

  <p>At 8 ft. 6 in. from the centre of the front of this structure, and
    immediately due south behind it, is a granite cement cone in splendid
    condition. This cone is 4 ft. 11 in. in circumference at base, and is
    1 ft. 4 in. high. At 10 in. due east of the first cone is a smaller
    one with a circumference at base of 2 ft. 4 in., and this is 6 in.
    high. The semi-circular structure and the two cones are connected by a
    flooring of the same excellent quality of cement, and are structurally
    one.</p>

  <p>On following the cement floor towards the north-east it was found to
    be decomposed by water and to have become like bright yellow clay. The
    lowest part of the surface of the interior of the eastern end of this
    temple is at this point, and from it rain-water could not escape. This
    decomposed cement was swagged and depressed considerably by the damp,
    but it was easily followed for 28 ft. 6 in. The granite cement floor
    runs in all directions from the semi-circular structure, but in most
    parts it is still solid, exceedingly hard, and in good condition.</p>

  <p>At the 28 ft. 6 in. point and at 5 ft. below the filled-in surface
    of the interior of the temple a cement cylinder was found. This is
    beautifully rounded and has four bevelled bosses, equi-distant, on
    its side. The cylinder was found upon a platform of the best cement
    yet discovered at Zimbabwe. It has a diameter of 1 ft. 8 in., is 5
    in. high, and has a circumference at the curved-in base of rounded
    side of 4 ft. 2 in. The bosses or knobs, which are bevelled, project<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
    outwards 1 in. The side is formed by three flat bevelled faces running
    all round, the centre bevelled face projecting half an inch beyond
    the others. The top is level, and the bottom part curves inwards at
    its base. The cylinder is perfectly free of any damage and is without
    the slightest scratch on its smooth surface. The workmanship is of
    so excellent a character that it is still almost equal in design and
    construction to any similar object that could be turned out at a
    European workshop.</p>

  <p>The cylinder stands on a platform at 3 ft. 6 in. from its front on west
    side, the face of the platform being formed of two almost semi-circular
    faces meeting and turning inwards some few inches eastwards towards the
    cylinder. The platform is 1 ft. 1 in. high on the northern curve, the
    southern extremity being well rounded off, while the northern extremity
    runs into and under a bank of débris not yet cleared away.</p>

  <p>The “finds” at the centre of the arc in this temple included the usual
    unpleasing emblems of Nature Worship; a piece of forked iron, more
    rust than iron, with six gold bosses the size of peas at equi-distant
    points; these are riveted on the iron with corresponding gold bosses on
    the opposite side, the rivets through the iron being of gold; a sheet
    of beaten gold 3½ in. by 2¼ in., also some fragments of beaten gold and
    gold tacks; fragments of soapstone bowls and beams, old pottery, some
    peculiarly shaped natural stones, including serpentine stones, and an
    Isafuba game stone.</p>

  <p>The “finds” at the cylinder were three large black beads with white
    lines possibly identical with a similar bead found by Bent on the
    Acropolis, to which (p. 205) he ascribes a very great age; also under
    the curved-in side of the cylinder were scratched out some fifty light
    green beads with encircling ribs, and these both local Makalanga and
    Barotse natives state are completely strange to them; some yellow and
    green glass beads of microscopic size, the holes being scarcely visible
    with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>out the aid of a magnifying glass; a miniature phallus carved,
    old pottery, and a small block of mica split up into sheets. In the
    side of the trench on a clay floor 1 ft. above, and at the back of
    the cylinder, is a stratum of ashes out of which a quantity of beaten
    copper sheetings, copper tacks, a large copper battle-axe, and a very
    thick copper bangle were drawn.</p>

  <p>Above the cylinder were at least four floors with ashes on each, and
    the remains of a furnace on two of them. Above the top floor were 3 ft.
    of very hard soil, and 18 in. of black soil, and on the top were the
    remains of a decayed tree, which must have been at least fifty or sixty
    years old.</p>

  <p><em>Covered Passage.</em>—This passage is at the eastern end of the temple, to
    which it served as an approach from <em>The Platform</em>. It is 2 ft. wide,
    6 ft. 6 in. high, has a rounded end on the north side, is 10 ft. long,
    and the high wall over it is supported by five large slate lintels. The
    passage opens out at the east end at the foot of <em>The Winding Stairs</em>.
    In the passage the writer found (August, 1902) a Makalanga grave, and
    with the permission of the local chief, the skeletal remains were
    removed and re-interred elsewhere.</p>

  <p><em>Platform Cave.</em>—This cave is immediately below <em>The Platform</em>, and
    opens on to the floor of the temple. It is 8 ft. to 10 ft. high
    throughout a length of 22 ft. At 11 ft. from the entrance the width
    is 2 ft. 10 in., and at the innermost point 4 ft. 6 in., where it is
    walled up with blocks. The cave is formed by an immense boulder on
    the east side and by two large boulders on the west side. It had two
    floors, the higher floor being 4 ft. above the lower one. The top
    floor, which was of red clay, was obviously of Makalanga make, but the
    lower one, which is made of granite cement, is believed to be of a late
    ancient period. Probably a still more ancient flooring may be found
    lower. On the top floor was a modern Makalanga grave, and the remains
    were removed elsewhere and re-interred. On the lower floor some of the
    fragments of the decorated soapstone found by Bent, and of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span> which he
    mentions what fragments were missing, were discovered by the writer
    within a few feet of the spot where Bent found the larger portions of
    this beam.</p>

  <p><em>Stairs to Platform.</em>—The entrance to the <em>Platform Cave</em> is narrowed
    by the lower steps of a flight of stairs rising from the interior of
    the temple over the two boulders, which form the northern side of
    the cave, up to the upper flight of stairs on the north side of <em>The
    Platform</em>. The steps are considerably ruined, but can be traced, the
    stones being covered with a cement not believed to be ancient.</p>

  <p><em>Parallel Passage.</em>—This passage extends from the point where the
    <em>Higher Parapet</em> enters the temple at its south-west corner, the south
    wall of the temple forming its south side. The eastern extremity of
    this passage is at the wide gap in the south wall. Its total length
    is 71 ft. The walls on the north side vary in height from 5 ft. to 13
    ft., according to the rise and fall of its floor. Its width varies
    from 2 ft. to 3 ft. Half-way along are traces of steps, also at its
    lowest point. This <em>Parallel Passage</em> appears to be similar in purpose,
    so far as can be surmised, to that of the <em>Parallel Passage</em> in the
    <em>Elliptical Temple</em> in the valley.</p>

  <p><em>Internal walls.</em>—These are five in number, so far as discoveries
    have been made; and for the purposes of this description, and for the
    assistance of visitors, are lettered A to E on boards affixed to the
    walls.</p>

  <p><i>A.</i> This is the wall mentioned in the description of the main west
    wall as being built up against the inner face of the main wall, and as
    protruding 9 ft. into the temple in a south-easterly direction.</p>

  <p><i>B.</i> This is a small isolated section of a wall with broken ends, and
    is 28 ft. south-west of the north wall, and 38 ft. from the west wall.
    It is 4 ft. long, 2 ft. 6 in. wide, 4 ft. high, and its faced sides are
    north-east and south-west.</p>

  <p><i>C.</i> A small isolated section of wall 38 ft. 6 in. from the north wall,
    and 44 ft. from the west wall. It is 5 ft. high and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>7 ft. wide, and
    its ends are broken. Its faces are fairly well built, its foundations
    rest on made ground, and red clay, not cement, can be seen on the
    trench all round the wall.</p>

    <div class="caption">BUTTRESS PASSAGE, ACROPOLIS</div>
  </div>

  <p><i>D.</i> A large wall stands at 9 ft. 6 in. from the west wall at a point
    42 ft. north from the south end of that wall. It has an abrupt and
    unfinished end facing south, from which end it rounds boldly towards
    the east, where it appears to terminate in a bank of soil debris. The
    quality of material and workmanship displayed in this wall are very
    similar to those of the west wall. Its height is 9 ft. where it faces
    the south, but where it faces west is a portion of wall 6 ft. high
    erected on its summit, and this upper wall is 6 ft. long and 4 ft.
    wide, being rounded at its end facing west. The sides of the upper and
    lower walls are flush to each other.</p>

  <p><i>E.</i> At the foot of the boulder over which the north wall is carried
    is a trench, and at a depth of 4 ft. below the present level of the
    interior of the temple is a very strong cemented floor, on which stands
    about 4 sq. ft. of the rounded end of a cement wall of most excellent
    material and make. These are believed to be ancient, and if such be
    the case, then no antiquity could be claimed for walls B and C, which
    are built upon the filled-in soil of a higher level. The remains of a
    rounded stone buttress are also to be seen in this trench. This trench
    was sunk through the red clay of a Makalanga threshing-floor.</p>

  <p><i>Sections of floors.</i>—Three sections of what are believed to be ancient
    floors can be seen in the cutting at the angle formed by the north
    and west walls. At 5 ft. below the present surface of the temple is
    an ancient floor of strong yellow granite cement 1 ft. 4 in. thick;
    above this is a red cement floor 1 ft. thick; above this is another red
    cement floor 1 ft. 2 in. thick; while the top floor is made of ordinary
    Makalanga clay. A red cement bed lies under the lowest floor.</p>

  <h3>PLATFORM ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap">THIS enclosure is on the north side of the <em>Western Temple</em>, and
    immediately at the foot of the stairs leading up the north-west side
    of <em>The Platform</em>. The east side is 46 ft. long, and is formed by a
    wall 19 ft. high and 7 ft. wide at 5 ft. above the present level of
    the interior. The north wall is 33 ft. along its face, and including
    a rounded corner at the north-east. It is 3 ft. wide at its present
    reduced height, which averages from 2 ft. 6 in. to 5 ft. above the rock
    floor. The north wall is built upon the edge of a high boulder, which
    boulder forms the floor of the enclosure on its north side. From north
    to north-west is an open space enclosed by a Makalanga-built wall which
    is carried across and blocks up an ancient entrance. From north-west to
    south the wall is 51 ft. long, and forms part of the north wall of the
    <em>Western Temple</em>. It is 4 ft. 6 in. wide on its present reduced summit,
    which is very dilapidated, its length including a wide gap. The extreme
    south-eastern side is formed by the walls supporting the steps from
    this enclosure to the summit of <em>The Platform</em>.</p>

  <p>In the south-east corner of this enclosure is a passage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span> leading into
    the <em>Cleft Rock Enclosure</em>. This passage is 10 ft. long, the walls on
    either side are 6 ft. in height, and the width varies from 2 ft. to
    4 ft. 10 in. This passage was only discovered in July, 1902, when it
    was found to contain a Makalanga grave apparently about twenty years
    old. The remains were removed and re-interred at the right side of the
    entrance to the <em>Cleft Rock Enclosure</em>. There were traces of steps in
    this passage, but these had been destroyed by masses of falling débris.</p>

  <p>On the east side and at 21 ft. from this passage is a large squared
    entrance, also leading into <em>Cleft Rock Enclosure</em>. This appears
    to be a reconstruction of an older entrance or a late construction
    altogether, or possibly a new entrance through an old wall. The
    entrance is 6 ft. high, 2 ft. 6 in. wide, 7 ft. long, and has squared
    walls. Most probably this entrance was originally covered, for the
    remains of slate lintels can be seen on either side in the wall above
    it, and quantities of long pieces of fractured slate beams were found
    on its floor.</p>

  <p>The area of this enclosure is divided into different levels. The floor
    on the south-west side for 28 ft. by 14 ft. is formed by the top of a
    huge flat-topped boulder. The floor at the extreme north is also formed
    by the top of a boulder. The middle portion between these two floors
    consists of a depression of some 10 ft. to 14 ft. lower than the rock
    floors on either side, the lowest portion being at the north-west end.</p>

  <p>In this depression, and running from the north-west toward the squared
    entrance in the east wall, is a deep and narrow passage, the wall of
    which on the south-west side is the retaining wall for the higher floor
    on that side. The north-east wall of the passage appears to have been
    a Makalanga reconstruction of an ancient wall, especially as several
    of the walls in the immediate vicinity are undoubtedly Makalanga, and
    claimed by them as such, and, moreover, Makalanga articles were found
    at the base of its foundation. Still, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span> wall is so dilapidated that
    it is difficult to state one’s opinion as to its age. This passage runs
    west for 72 ft. throughout the length of this enclosure, and passes
    out on to the <em>Western Parapet</em>, which runs along the west base of the
    west wall of the <em>Western Temple</em>. The width of the passage varies
    from 2 ft. to 4 ft., and with side walls averaging in height 5 ft. to
    14 ft. on the south side, and 4 ft. to 7 ft. on the north side. In
    the description of the newly discovered <em>North-West Ancient Ascent</em>,
    it will be seen that this passage forms an important section in that
    ascent.</p>

  <p>At the south-east corner of the enclosure, and extending for 6 ft. from
    the east wall, is a small wall of three different faces at different
    levels all facing north. It was evidently intended to act as a buttress
    to the steps from <em>The Platform</em> down into the narrow passage between
    the two side floors of this enclosure.</p>

  <h3>CLEFT ROCK ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>This enclosure lies to the east of the <em>Platform Enclosure</em>, and its
    west wall is the same as forms the east wall of that enclosure. At all
    other points its sides are formed by cliffs and large boulders rising
    to the height of some 50 ft. and 60 ft. The west side is 46 ft. long,
    and its north and south sides are about 86 ft. each in length, these
    meeting at their extreme east.</p>

  <p><em>Cleft Rock</em>, which is so very often seen in photographs of the
    Zimbabwe ruins, rises for about 25 ft. above the surface of the
    enclosure on its north side and extends downwards for 15 ft. below it
    on the outside. It is 3 ft. 10 in. to 4 ft. 6 in. wide throughout.
    Possibly it was an ancient ascent from the <em>Rock Holes Walk</em>, as a
    quantity of wall débris lies at its outside base.</p>

  <p>All the divisional walls of the interior are undoubtedly of Makalanga
    construction, and the local Makalanga claim them as having been made
    early in the time of Mokomo, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>the previous Zimbabwe chief, whose
    kraal occupied the north summit of this hill. This remark does not
    apply to the buttresses on either side of the west entrance.</p>

    <div class="caption">A NATURAL ARCHWAY IN CENTRAL PASSAGE, ACROPOLIS</div>
  </div>

  <p>The enclosure is approached on the south-west by the recently opened
    passage at the north foot of <em>The Platform</em> steps, also on the west by
    the squared entrance from the <em>Platform Enclosure</em>, and on the south
    it is believed to have had an entrance through the <em>Buttress Passage</em>
    (described later). The huge pile of stone-wall débris on the south
    side was recently stacked here, having been removed from the <em>Platform
    Enclosure</em> and passage.</p>

  <h3>THE PLATFORM</h3>

  <p>This is an elevated position at the east corner of the <em>Western
    Temple</em>, commanding a splendid view of the whole of the interior of
    the temple and of the surrounding enclosures. It appears to have been
    erected for the same purposes as were <em>The Platform</em> in the <em>Elliptical
    Temple</em> in the valley, and the <em>Ancient Balcony</em> in the <em>Eastern
    Temple</em> on the hill.</p>

  <p>Its height is 27 ft. 6 in. above the present floor of the temple, and
    about 32 ft. above any of its ancient floors. It is 250 ft. above the
    level of the valley. The summit of <em>The Platform</em> projects out towards
    the west from the upper face of a huge boulder which forms the west end
    of the cliffs and boulders which ridge along the summit of this hill.</p>

  <p>A wall 2 ft. high and from 1 ft. 10 in. to 2 ft. 6 in. wide runs west
    from the boulder at the back across the centre of <em>The Platform</em> and
    terminates in a rounded end overlooking the temple. On the east side of
    this low wall is an embrasure 3 ft. wide, also overlooking the temple,
    at the south end of which is a parapet wall now from 1 ft. to 3 ft.
    high and 12 ft. long, also on the edge of the temple wall. This forms
    the west side of the approach to <em>The Platform</em> from the south, which
    is further formed by the <em>Winding Stairs</em>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span></p>

  <p>On the north side of <em>The Platform</em> is a flight of stairs, now
    considerably ruined by roots of trees forcing out the steps. This
    flight ascends from the granite rock floor of the <em>Platform Enclosure</em>
    from between two rounded buttresses. Half-way up the steps pass between
    two small, low walls, the space between them being 2 ft. These walls
    are parallel for a few feet, but as the steps descend they round off
    on each side away from the steps. This flight of stairs is the last
    and highest section of the <em>North-West Ancient Ascent</em> from the valley
    where are the large water-holes or dongas (see <em>North-West Ancient
    Ascent</em>).</p>

  <p>At the top of these steps and on the east side of <em>The Platform</em> is the
    celebrated <em>Dentelle Pattern</em>.</p>

  <p>This ancient wall decoration is the sixth yet discovered in Rhodesia,
    and until more is known of the similar pattern at Matendele Ruins, it
    can be tentatively concluded that this pattern on <em>The Platform</em> is by
    far the best and the most complete specimen extant in Rhodesia.</p>

  <p>Its present dimensions are 3 ft. 6 in. wide and 3 ft. 6 in. high,
    and it consists of four columns of small, shallow blocks laid flat,
    with corners outwards, and flush with each other, each block thus
    showing two faces, the whole enclosed on top, bottom, and south sides
    by an angular frame of large blocks. The north side of the frame has
    disappeared. It is probable that this pattern once possessed a fifth
    column of dentelle blocks, as the foundations, providing sufficient
    space for another column, still remain, and there are more of these
    small blocks lying in the débris below, each with two faces, generally
    time-worn. This pattern faces west, but very slightly to the south of
    west. In the summer of the Southern Hemisphere it exactly faces the
    setting sun, the great slanting monolith then being between it and the
    setting sun.</p>

  <p>The other special features of <em>The Platform</em> are the <em>Monoliths</em>.</p>

  <p>Two tall and flat-faced granite monoliths are still standing <span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>on
    <em>The Platform</em>, while one slate monolith lies prone on the south floor
    of <em>The Platform</em>, with a few feet of its length projecting over the
    temple wall. This last monolith is 10 ft. long, and at its centre part
    is 2 ft. 2 in. in circumference. This monolith is intact.</p>

    <div class="caption">DENTELLE PATTERN ON PLATFORM, WESTERN TEMPLE, ACROPOLIS</div>
  </div>

  <p>The heights of the two standing monoliths are: the erect monolith 8 ft.
    above <em>The Platform</em>, and the slanting monolith 11 ft. 6 in., and their
    respective circumferences are 2 ft. 2 in. and 2 ft. 9 in. The one in
    front of the <em>Dentelle Pattern</em> slants considerably to due north.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
    Its base, built into the wall, must be of great length to support the
    enormous weight of this large and slanting slab of granite, especially
    as this monolith had once been of greater length. The fracture on its
    top can be seen from the summit of the boulder behind. The fractured
    portion was found at the foot of the stairs, and this measures 3 ft.
    2 in., thus making the exposed portion of the monolith not less than
    14 ft. 8 in. in length. There is no evidence of the slanting of the
    monolith having taken place since its erection.</p>

  <h3>BALCONY WALL</h3>

  <p>This is on the south side of <em>The Platform</em>, from which it is reached.
    The top of this wall is level with the top of the <em>Winding Stairs</em>, and
    it forms the western end of <em>East Passage</em>, and the eastern wall of
    the <em>Western Temple</em>. It is 21 ft. long and from 4 ft. to 6 ft. wide.
    Through it is the <em>Covered Passage</em> (see <em>Western Temple</em>).</p>

  <h3>LITTLE ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>This can be seen from the <em>Balcony Wall</em> between the southern end of
    which and the <em>Upper Passage</em> it lies. It is 8 ft. deep, 5 ft. wide,
    and 11 ft. long. The entrance appears to have been at outside of the
    south-western end of the <em>Upper Passage</em>. It is almost entirely filled
    up with débris. It once had a granite cement dado 3 in. thick on its
    sides, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>some of which still remain intact. It is from this enclosure
    that the drain-hole on the west side of the <em>Upper Passage</em> emerges.</p>

  <h3>THE WINDING STAIRS</h3>

  <p>These lead from <em>The Platform</em> to the <em>East Passage</em>, which again leads
    to the eastern extremity of the <em>Acropolis Ruins</em>. The stairs are 14
    ft. long, and descend 8 ft., and are 4 ft. to 6 ft. wide. The wall on
    the south side is 4 ft. to 7 ft. high as the stairs descend. The wall
    at the east end is 7 ft. high. The face of a huge boulder forms the
    north side. The foot of the stairs, where they turn towards the south,
    is covered by a narrow wall supported by an old wooden beam. This beam
    is not ancient, but the old Makalanga who occupied these ruins may have
    inserted it to make the stairs safer to use. Fragments of slate lintel
    were found in the débris at the foot of the stairs.</p>

  <h3>UPPER PASSAGE</h3>

  <p>This passage, which is 28 ft. long, connects the bottom of the <em>Winding
    Stairs</em> and the south side of the interior of the <em>Western Temple</em>. On
    the east side the wall is from 4 ft. 6 in. to 6 ft. high, and 5 ft.
    to 10 ft. on the west side. It is 3 ft. 6 in. wide throughout. It is
    approached at the northern end between buttresses, the one on the west
    side being round, while the one on the eastern side is rounded on the
    inner side and angular on the outer side. On the west side are the
    remains of a drain emerging from the <em>Little Enclosure</em> and a fragment
    of the slate beam which once carried the wall across it is still to
    be seen in the hole. This passage, though at the foot of the <em>Winding
    Stairs</em>, is some 8 ft. higher than the present floor of the <em>Western
    Temple</em>.</p>

  <h3>EAST PASSAGE</h3>

  <p>This passage is 80 ft. long from the foot of the <em>Winding Stairs</em> to
    the north side of <em>South Enclosure C</em>. At the foot <span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>of the <em>Winding
    Stairs</em> the passage-way turns east, the north side for 13 ft. being
    a large rounded buttress 6 ft. high. On the south side at this point
    is the eastern end of the <em>Covered Passage</em> leading up from the floor
    of the <em>Western Temple</em>, and a few feet further east is the northern
    entrance to the <em>Upper Passage</em>.</p>

    <div class="caption">WEST ENTRANCE TO SOUTH CAVE, ACROPOLIS</div>
  </div>

  <p>From the 14 ft. length to the 31 ft. length of the passage going east
    are remains—only very ruined—of cement steps descending to a lower
    level. On the south side of this passage are <em>South Enclosure A</em>,
    <em>South Passage</em>, and <em>South Enclosures B and C</em>. The north side is
    formed by high, cliff-like boulders. The <em>Buttress Passage</em> starts
    north at the north side of the 51 ft. length going east. At the
    entrance to <em>Buttress Passage</em> a tree has lifted up a granite block 6
    ft. from the ground. It is firmly fixed in the bark of the tree.</p>

  <h3>BUTTRESS PASSAGE</h3>

  <p>This passage runs north and south for 39 ft. between two gigantic
    cliff-boulders on the summit of the hill. This passage connected the
    enclosures on the north and south sides of the cliff. The rocks on
    either side of the passage at its bottom and south end are 50 ft. high
    on the east side, and 35 ft. high on the west side, and at the upper or
    north end are from 15 ft. to 20 ft. high. The path ascends throughout
    its length, and its upper end is 14 ft. above the lower end. The width
    between the rocks varies from 4 ft. to 6 ft., but the top exit of the
    path goes between rocks only 3 ft. apart.</p>

  <p>The floor between the two cliffs is artificially made, and near the
    summit it has crowned in, and this crowning-in now bars the ascent to
    the <em>Cleft Rock Enclosure</em>, to which it formed an entrance from the
    south.</p>

  <p>The passage has been considerably narrowed by buttresses alternating on
    either side, these making the passage a true zigzag. The first buttress
    at the south end and on the west<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span> side is much reduced in height, being
    now but 1 ft. 6 in. This buttress is angular, and protrudes 2 ft. On
    the east side is a long rounded buttress, which leaves the passage 2
    ft. wide between it and the first buttress. This second buttress is 4
    ft. high, 7 ft. long, and protrudes 4 ft., the width of the passage
    between it and the opposite cliff being 1 ft. 3 in. The third buttress
    is 17 ft. from the south end of the passage; it is angular, and
    projects from the west side 2 ft., and is now only 2 ft. 6 in. high.
    The fourth buttress is angular on the bottom side and rounded on the
    top side. This projects 3 ft. 6 in. from the west side, and is 5 ft.
    high. Between the third and fourth buttresses the passage is 2 ft.
    wide. Above the fourth buttress the floor has crowned in, and on the
    upper side of the crowning-in is a wall 5 ft. high built across the
    passage. Judging by block débris, this wall, the summit of which is
    level with the floor of the <em>Cleft Rock Enclosure</em>, was once surmounted
    by steps.</p>

  <h3>SOUTH ENCLOSURE A</h3>

  <p>This enclosure is 51 ft. long from east to west, and is 25 ft. wide at
    its broadest point. Its shape is that of a long, narrow triangle, the
    apex resting at its south-east end. Most of the south wall has fallen
    over the edge of the precipice. There are two rounded entrances on the
    north side from the <em>East Passage</em>. The walls remaining are from 5 ft.
    to 7 ft. high. There is a drain-hole through the south wall at the
    south-east corner. The <em>South Passage</em> forms the eastern side. On the
    west side is a narrow recess between two boulders, and this appears to
    have been roofed over with slate and granite lintels, but the recess is
    now blocked up by wall débris. This enclosure appears to have been once
    divided into two enclosures, as a broken wall, 5 ft. long, 3 ft. high,
    and 3 ft. 6 in. wide, juts out into the interior from the east side.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span></p>

  <h3>SOUTH CAVE</h3>

  <p>This “cave” hardly deserves the name of cave, but as previous writers
    gave it this designation the title is retained in this description.</p>

  <p>The cave is situated immediately under <em>South Enclosure A</em>, and it
    opens on to the actual brink of the south precipice, being approached
    from both west and east sides by a path built along the top slope of
    the precipice. It is formed by a large boulder 16 ft. high and 17 ft.
    long, and is between this boulder and the top of the precipice, the
    floor being the natural rock of the declivity. It recedes but 3 ft.
    to 6 ft. under the boulder and is 7 ft. wide. It is 5 ft. high on the
    outside and only 1 ft. 6 in. to 2 ft. at its innermost part. It has
    been thoroughly cleaned out, but nothing of any antiquarian value was
    found. The boulder beetles outwards towards the face of the precipice.</p>

  <p>Immediately in front of this cave and on the south side and at 4 ft.
    distance a wall averaging 8 ft. in height runs for 37 ft. towards the
    west. The boulder which forms the cave beetles outwards over this wall,
    and judging by the block débris, the wall was once continued up to, and
    connected with, the rock above. This wall at its western extremity has
    a well-built rounded end in a good state of preservation.</p>

  <p>On the north side and starting at 10 ft. from the cave and running
    west for 46 ft. is a wall 8 ft. high with a rounded end at its eastern
    extremity. It starts from the face of the boulder forming the cave, and
    is continued until it reaches the interior of the <em>Western Temple</em>.</p>

  <p>These two walls form a passage averaging a width of 4 ft., though at
    the end of the south wall it narrows to 2 ft. 6 in. In the passage are
    traces of granite cement steps. This passage on entering the <em>Western
    Temple</em> is directly end on with the <em>Parallel Passage</em>, which is on the
    inside of the main south wall and is separated from it only by the gap
    in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span> outer wall, the main wall having at this point fallen down the
    precipice and taken with it the side wall of the passage from the cave.
    It is almost certain that this passage was but the extension of the
    <em>Parallel Passage</em>.</p>

  <p>On the eastern side of the cave is a built-up space between the boulder
    forming the cave and another boulder further east which beetles
    parallel to the precipice for 13 ft. This wall is 10 ft. high and is 6
    ft. across.</p>

  <p>The path to the east passes under this outer and beetling boulder,
    and between the outer side of <em>South Enclosure A</em> and the edge of the
    precipice, but here it is so much dilapidated by wall débris falling
    from above, that the safer approach to the cave is from the <em>Western
    Temple</em>.</p>

  <p>On the summits of these two large boulders are traces of a substantial
    wall once having been carried across them.</p>

  <h3>SOUTH PASSAGE</h3>

  <p>This passage is almost opposite the south end of <em>Buttress Passage</em>
    and leads from the <em>East Passage</em> to the edge of the south precipice,
    dividing <em>South Enclosures A and B</em>. It is 38 ft. long, from 1 ft. 6
    in. to 2 ft. wide, and at each extremity has rounded ends on either
    side. The wall on the east side averages 3 ft. to 7 ft. in height, the
    highest being at the southern end. The wall on the west side averages 7
    ft. to 12 ft. in height.</p>

  <p>The existence of this passage was, until July, 1902, unsuspected, as it
    had been filled up and entirely covered over with wall débris, across
    which was the visitors’ path, which crossed the débris at 7 ft. above
    the present exposed floor.</p>

  <h3>SOUTH ENCLOSURE B</h3>

  <p>This enclosure is on the east side of <em>South Passage</em>, and overlooks
    the south precipice. Its area is 37 ft. from east to west, and 31 ft.
    from north to south. The wall on the north side is 16 ft. high, and 4
    ft. 6 in. wide at 5 ft. from the floor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span> and is the best-built portion
    now remaining. It has three rounded entrances, one from <em>South Passage</em>
    and two from <em>East Passage</em>. Low walls of poor construction subdivide
    the enclosure into three compartments, but some portions of these walls
    are not believed to be ancient.</p>

  <h3>SOUTH ENCLOSURE C</h3>

  <p>This is on the north-east side of <em>South Enclosure B</em>, but on a level
    of some 6 ft. higher. The area is 41 ft. from east to west, and 19 ft.
    from north to south. The eastern wall curves outwards, and is 9 ft.
    high. The north side is formed by a large boulder, the west side by a
    raised parapet which is the eastern extremity of <em>East Passage</em>. There
    is one entrance only, and this is in the south-western corner. Here the
    south wall is very well built. A wall 3 ft. 6 in. high and 9 ft. long
    juts out southwards from the boulder on the north side.</p>

  <h3>CENTRAL PASSAGE</h3>

  <p>This passage connects <em>Cleft Rock Enclosure</em> and the <em>Eastern Temple</em>
    and forms the most direct communication between the western and
    eastern extremities of the <em>Acropolis</em>. This passage is practically
    the north-east extension of <em>Pattern Passage</em>, the two joining end on
    at the west entrance to the <em>Eastern Temple</em>. Cliffs and huge boulders
    form the main portion of its sides.</p>

  <p>Its length is 76 ft., and its width varies from 3 ft. to 4 ft. 6 in.
    There is a sharp rise of 6 ft. going west, at about half-way along its length.</p>

  <p>At the eastern end it lies between two large boulders, the one on the
    north side being 12 ft. long and 10 ft. high. This boulder has fallen
    from the position it occupied at the time of the ancients, and is come
    6 ft. further south, destroying and blocking up the west entrance to
    the <em>Eastern Temple</em>. The boulder on the south side is 8 ft. long and
    14 ft. high,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span> and up against it, and projecting into the passage, was
    once a rounded buttress, traces of which now only remain.</p>

  <p>At 22 ft. going west is another large boulder, which forms the south
    side of the passage for a further 24 ft. This rock beetles right over
    the passage, and the open space under the boulder has been carefully
    walled up. At 48 ft. the south side is formed for a further 14 ft. by a
    low wall, in which are enclosed two boulders. On this side wall are the
    remains of a path leading from the passage to <em>South Enclosure C</em>, but
    a portion of this has crowned in and disappeared.</p>

  <p>The north side of the passage from its eastern end is formed by the
    boulder, 12 ft. long, just described, and for a further 35 ft. by a
    step-back wall 8 ft. high, along the summit of which was a path with
    steps leading into the <em>Eastern Temple</em>, but now blocked up by large
    scales of granite which have fallen from the face of the cliff above.</p>

  <p>The western extremity of this passage is formed by two boulders, one
    on either side, the one on the south side leaning up against the one
    on the north side, thus forming a natural arch 14 ft. long and 10 ft.
    high, the path descending about 4 ft. in passing through the archway,
    and rising sharply again where it emerges on the opposite end of the
    archway into <em>Cleft Rock Enclosure</em>, and runs for 27 ft. further west
    into the enclosure, where it ends on the south side in a rounded wall
    5 ft. high. Large rocks form the north side. In the archway and on the
    south side under the boulder is a rock hole 5 ft. broad, 4 ft. deep,
    extending under the base of the boulder for 6 ft.</p>

  <p>In the passage are traces of steps, but the passage has been greatly
    damaged by falls of large slabs from the cliffs.</p>

  <h3>THE EASTERN TEMPLE</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap">THIS temple is situated at the most easterly part of Zimbabwe Hill
    Ruins, on the south side of the line of high cliffs and gigantic
    boulders which extend from the east to the west along the summit of the
    hill. The centre of the present surface of the interior of this temple
    is 222 ft. above the valley.</p>

  <p>The main wall is built on a wide curve towards the east extending 98
    ft. from the south face of the cliff on the north side round to the
    south side, thus disposing the area in a quarter section of a circle
    with the apex of the section at the north-north-west of the interior.</p>

  <p>A cliff rising perpendicularly for 70 ft. from the floor of the temple
    forms the north side of the area, and the west side is formed by
    colossal boulders some 30 ft. to 50 ft. in height. The heights and the
    massiveness of the cliff and boulders lend a peculiar awe-inspiring
    appearance to this temple. These granite rocks, tapestried by Nature
    in all possible colours and shades of lichen, enclose two sides of
    the interior in the form of an amphitheatre, with the highest portion
    of the temple floor at the north end, the present surface gradually
    sloping down in a fall of 12 ft. towards the curved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span> main and outer
    wall to its east and south-eastern points. On the highest part of this
    slope are two well-built retaining walls forming terraces behind them.
    These are described later.</p>

  <p>This temple is considerably better built than is the <em>Western Temple</em>
    on this hill. The blocks in the walls are more carefully selected and
    fit together more perfectly, are of a better class of granite, and the
    courses are truer, while it would appear from the extent of purely
    artistic detail and finish introduced by the original builders that far
    greater skill was bestowed upon its construction than on that of the
    <em>Western Temple</em>.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_324">
    <img src="images/i_324.jpg" width="600" height="597" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Section of<br />EASTERN TEMPLE<br />Acropolis, Zimbabwe.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Both temples are built strictly upon the lines of the First<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span> Period of
    Zimbabwe architecture, all of the features of the Second Period being
    altogether absent. Certainly some of the cement work of the higher
    floors appears to be ancient, but not of the period of the original
    builders, and it is possible that the Second Period ancients occupied
    the buildings, and finding them in such excellent condition, had no
    need to make repairs or extensions to the walls as they did in so many
    scores of First Period ruins throughout the country. The floors of the
    original builders of this temple have been opened out by a trench and
    exposed at a minimum depth of 4 ft. below the latest floor.</p>

  <p>Bent and other writers have stated that this temple is orientated to
    the rising of the sun, which can be seen on a level and fairly distant
    horizon. The temple obviously affords a splendid natural means for
    observing the meridian.</p>

  <p>On midwinter day (1902), in the Southern Hemisphere, the sun rose
    facing the eastern end of the main wall, and shone on the line of
    <em>Dentelle Pattern</em>, and also for an hour afterwards shone on the
    inside of the south-western end of the wall, and also on that of the
    floor. At the end of that time, and until 10.30 a.m., the sun did not
    shine on the temple, but only on the inside face of the summit of the
    south-west end of the curved main wall, the sun being hidden by the
    70-ft. cliff on the north side of the interior. At 11 a.m. it shone
    over the cliff on to the south-western side of the interior. Half an
    hour before midday the sun shone on the inside of the southern wall and
    on the south floor from over the cliff, and also in a single narrow
    bar across the floor of the building through the north entrance to the
    temple, which is formed by a long and narrow passage between the high
    cliffs and some gigantic boulders. The sun shone through this narrow
    opening till about half an hour after midday, when the sun had passed
    the face of this narrow entrance, and only shone on the south-west and
    north-west portions of the interior from over the <em>Ancient Balcony</em>,
    which is much lower than the cliff, till a little after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span> one o’clock,
    the sun then ceasing to shine on the interior for the rest of the day.
    At the spot where the line from the point of sunrise at the summer
    solstice cuts the midday beam of light which comes through the cliff
    entrance on the north, is the site of the ancient altar as determined
    by Bent, the site being true south of the north passage. It was at
    this spot that Bent found the pottery and soapstone solar discs, the
    decorated and plain phalli, the soapstone birds, carved beams, and
    decorated bowls resembling Phœnician ware. The writer’s examination
    of this spot was rewarded by “finds” of carved soapstone in great
    quantities.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_326">
    <img src="images/i_326.jpg" width="450" height="500" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Plan of<br />EASTERN TEMPLE<br />Acropolis, Zimbabwe</div>
  </div>

  <p>So obviously noticeable is the beam of light at midday that as the sun
    quickly passed the end of the long and narrow rock passage the natives
    working for the writer fixed their noon “<i>Tjiya!</i>” (“Cease work!”) by
    it, and this they did on their own initiative.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span></p>

  <p>Another feature may be noticed. A small circle of sunlight, about 2 ft.
    diameter, crosses the floor of the temple in a course equal to about a
    fifth part of the radius of a circle from the entrance to the <em>Balcony
    Enclosure</em> across the floor where Bent fixes the site of the ancient
    altar and passes over the eastern wall. This must have been observed by
    the ancients, for it is caused by a small opening between two boulders
    which they have utilised in “forming” the <em>Ancient Balcony</em>. At 3 p.m.
    this circle of light in the sunless interior, on the same day, rested
    on the spot at which, according to Bent, the ancient altar stood.</p>

  <p>On Midsummer Day, 1903, the whole temple area was flooded with sunlight
    at noontide.</p>

  <p>These particulars are given merely as matters of interest to the
    general reader, and scientists are referred to <cite>The Ruined Cities of
    Mashonaland</cite>, by Bent, for his calculations as to the orientation of
    this temple. Bent has given his opinion, based upon survey, that this
    temple was used for observing the summer solstice.</p>

  <p>Two points, however, which may bear upon the orientation of this
    building and its use in the observation of sunrise and meridian may be
    noticed.</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) No other temple which has been surveyed by scientists for the
    purpose of ascertaining its orientation, whether at Zimbabwe or
    elsewhere in Rhodesia, was so plentifully adorned with monoliths of
    carved slate or soapstone as was this temple, no less than thirty
    fallen monoliths, and the fractured portions of many others, having
    been found at the bases of the walls both inside and outside, while
    the débris heaps, which have only been very partially searched, must
    yet contain other specimens. No other temple, so far discovered, had
    such a profusion of geometrically carved soapstone beams as were
    unearthed by Bent and by other explorers before him. This would appear
    to still further testify to the importance the ancients attached to the
    decoration of this temple, whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span> used for observing the seasons of
    the year and astronomical occurrences or not.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) The position of the <em>Dentelle Pattern</em> in two courses on the
    eastern face of the summit of the main wall is fixed on exactly the
    same plan as is shown in so many other ruins of temple buildings in
    Rhodesia (and the discovery of the ancient emblems of faith have so
    far only been made in buildings so decorated, on identical positions,
    with one of the three oldest patterns, namely, Dentelle, Chevron, or
    Herring-bone), and as this is so unmistakably seen in the case of
    numerous other ruins of similar buildings, the position of the pattern
    in this instance can hardly be a mere coincidence.</p>

  <p>The <em>Dentelle Pattern</em>, which forms a distinguishing feature at the
    Zimbabwe ruins both on the hill and in the valley, and which is only
    found in First Period buildings, is, in this instance, believed to
    have originally extended some 30 ft. further towards the south-west,
    as a trace of it still remains on the highest remaining portion of
    the 39 ft. length of the main wall. The pattern throughout the 24 ft.
    length of main wall is somewhat damaged at several points, and the rows
    of stones which in all instances elsewhere covered this pattern have
    almost disappeared.</p>

  <p>The interior measurements of this temple are as follows: 59 ft. 6 in.
    from north to south, the northern point for measurement being the
    large roughly built step at the south end of the <em>North Passage</em>;
    66 ft. from south-east to north-west, the north-west point for
    measurement being the step at the bottom of the stairs leading from
    the temple to <em>Balcony Enclosure</em>; and 50 ft. from west-south-west to
    north-north-east.</p>

  <p>The main wall is 98 ft. long, measuring along its inside face, and
    starts on the eastern side from the south face of the cliff for 10 ft.
    to the rounded entrance to the <em>Gold Furnace Enclosure</em>. This 10 ft.
    length of wall is 8 ft. higher than the interior floor at the cliff
    end, and is 5 ft. high at the entrance. The entrance is 3 ft. wide at
    the present top and 2 ft. on its floor. From the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>rounded entrance
    the wall runs facing east-south-east for 24 ft. This section of the
    main wall stands 8 ft. above the present level of the interior, but 12
    ft. 6 in. from an ancient floor exposed in a trench sunk some 4 ft. 6
    in. into the present floor. At the south end of this length there is
    a gap in the wall of 22 ft., the wall which remains rising only 6 in.
    above the present surface of the lowest part of the temple. The wall
    starts again at the south end of the gap, and runs for 39 ft. towards
    the south-south-west. The highest portion of this length is 11 ft. 3
    in. above the ancient floor as exposed in the trench cut along the
    interior face of the main wall, the south-western end of the wall being
    only 4 ft. higher than the <em>Western Entrance</em>, which has been raised at
    a later period 5 ft. 6 in. above the original floor of the entrance.</p>

    <div class="caption">SUNKEN PASSAGE, LOOKING EAST, EASTERN TEMPLE, ACROPOLIS</div>
  </div>

  <p>The widths of the main wall are as follows:—</p>

  <p>The 10 ft. length is 7 ft. wide at the present floor, but was probably
    wider, as its eastern face has fallen out into the <em>Gold Furnace
    Enclosure</em>, which is immediately below. The angle between the east
    outside face and the cliff was filled in by a rounded buttress, which
    has also collapsed and fallen into the enclosure below.</p>

  <p>The 24 ft. length is 4 ft. 7 in. wide on the present summit. At 12 ft.
    south of the <em>Eastern Entrance</em>, an inner or banquette wall runs along
    the inside of the main wall, and stands out 2 ft. at its north end, 7
    ft. at south end, till it narrows into and becomes part of the main
    wall at the <em>Western Entrance</em>.</p>

  <p>The 22 ft. length is 5 ft. wide at the bottom of the gap, with a
    further width of 3 ft. 6 in., which includes that of the banquette wall.</p>

  <p>The 39 ft. length of main wall is 5 ft. wide on the summit, and this
    with the width of the banquette wall, which at this point is 5 ft. 6
    in. wide, makes a total width of 10 ft. 6 in.</p>

  <p>The heights of the main wall from the outer bases are as follows:—</p>

  <p>The 10 ft. length is 24 ft. above its base, and this, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span> 24
    ft. length of main wall, forms the western side of the <em>Gold Furnace
    Enclosure</em>.</p>

  <p>The 24 ft. length is 25 ft. high, and is divided into two depths, one
    below the other, 11 ft. and 14 ft., the 11 ft. being the wall and the
    14 ft. being a long buttress which starts at 9 ft. from the south side
    of the 22 ft. gap and runs to the cliff. The main wall, however, is
    continued down to the base of the buttress which is built up against
    it. This buttress forms a terraced passage, and was probably the way
    the ancients passed from the <em>Eastern Temple</em> to the <em>Gold Furnace
    Enclosure</em> below by means of a natural bridge formed by a long and
    narrow boulder, the west end of which is built into the buttress, down
    the north side of which is a narrow descent with a few block steps
    still remaining.</p>

  <p>The 39 ft. length is 22 ft. higher than the débris at its outer base,
    it is 17 ft. higher than the débris at the centre of the main wall,
    and 11 ft. at the steps which lead up from <em>Pattern Passage</em> to the
    <em>Western Entrance</em> of the <em>Eastern Temple</em>.</p>

  <p>On the top of the south banquette wall were most probably steps leading
    up to within 2 ft. or 3 ft. of the summit of the wall as if for a
    look-out. A rounded buttress stands out 2 ft. 6 in. from the main wall,
    and between it and the inner edge of the banquette wall are some blocks
    which, though displaced, have fallen in such a way as to provide very
    strong grounds for this conjecture.</p>

  <p>The <em>Eastern Entrance</em> has a pair of buttresses on a semi-circular
    platform projecting 7 ft. into the temple area, the faces of the
    buttresses being rounded and flush with the outside edge of this
    platform. The buttress on the north-east side is 3 ft., and judging by
    débris, it was once at least 7 ft. high. The opposite buttress is now
    only 1 ft. 6 in. high. (For measurements of this entrance, see <em>Main Wall</em>.)</p>

  <p>Between the south buttress and the banquette wall which runs southwards
    along the inside of the wall is another raised platform or “blind
    steps,” but very ruined and pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>jecting now only 2 ft. from the main
    wall. Among the loose stones on the top of this small platform, which
    is 6 ft. long, Bent found one of the soapstone birds which has a
    <i>cystos</i>, with sections of a carved soapstone beam, all of which are
    now in the museum at Capetown.</p>

  <p>At the north side of this entrance is a wall 15 ft. long reaching
    from the entrance to an angular point in the north cliff. This space
    so enclosed was built up inside in the form of steps, or blind steps,
    for they led nowhere, resembling the blind steps in <em>Nos. 7, 9, and 12
    Enclosures</em>, and in the <em>Sacred Enclosure</em> (<em>west</em>) in the <em>Elliptical
    Temple</em> in the valley. The face of a small buttress protrudes some 18
    in. from the face of this wall at about midway. Possibly this may have
    been the lowest step of the blind steps built up in this corner. In
    1888 this raised platform had on its summit a soapstone bird and beams.
    In 1903 two phalli and sections of four soapstone beams were found
    here, also small gold beads on and near this platform.</p>

  <p>The <em>North Entrance</em> is a narrow and deep rock passage 23 ft. long.
    The east side is formed by the north-west end of the north cliff, and
    is 45 ft. higher than the floor of the passage, but it beetles over
    the passage for 6 ft. beyond its north-western side, and so forms,
    with the immense boulders on the north-west side, an almost complete
    archway right over the passage. The passage is from 2 ft. to 7 ft. 10
    in. wide, but with rounded buttresses, the foundations and débris of
    which still remain, and also with a boulder that almost blocks the
    passage; the width of the passage throughout its whole length could not
    have been more than 2 ft. before the buttresses had become dilapidated.
    The passage emerges at its north end on the <em>North Plateau</em> (described
    later).</p>

  <p>The <em>West Entrance</em> is formed by the rounded end of the western
    extremity of the main wall and a large boulder between which it passes.
    On its present floor it is only 1 ft. 10 in. wide, the wall side having
    some six courses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span> of blocks exposed. The boulder on the north side has
    moved some 2 ft. into the entrance since the wall was built, and so
    partially closed it up, for originally the floor of the entrance was
    fully 5 ft. lower, and passed into the temple without steps. This was
    discovered to be the case when the upper portion of <em>Pattern Passage</em>
    was cleared out (July, 1902), when steps were made over the entrance
    débris to enable visitors to pass from <em>Pattern Passage</em> into the
    temple.</p>

  <p>The remains of another raised platform—but this one of granite
    cement—are on the west side of the interior immediately on the
    left-hand side on entering the temple at the west entrance. This
    platform is now ruined owing to its having been trodden on by oxen when
    this temple was used as a cattle kraal. In 1888 three large soapstone
    birds on tall beams stood on this platform, but in 1890 were removed by
    Bent, and are now in the museum at Capetown. The holes in the cement
    made by Bent on digging out the bases of the beams can still be seen.</p>

  <p>From 6 ft. north of this last-mentioned platform is some semi-circular
    clay-work rising in three tiers. Possibly these were steps leading up
    to the highest terraced level of the interior, but it may be doubted
    whether they had any claim to antiquity.</p>

  <p><em>Sunken Passage.</em>—This passage runs from south-west to north-east under
    the present floor of the Eastern Temple for 23 ft., starting from
    inside the banquette wall at 8 ft. east of the west entrance. Its depth
    is 9 ft. below the surface of interior of temple, but its side walls
    are only 7 ft. high. It is 4 ft. wide at the south end and 6 ft. wide
    at the north. At north-east end is a rounded buttress 5 ft. high. No
    approach or steps down into the passage have so far been discovered.
    The passage terminates at the large buttress (already mentioned), the
    summit of which is 4 ft. below the surface, is situated within 3 ft.
    and immediately in front of Bent’s “altar.” The east side wall of the
    passage is better built than the west side.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span></p>

  <p><i>Bent’s “altar.”</i>—This “altar” was stated by Bent to be 10 ft. nearer
    to the rising sun at the solstice than the centre of the arc of the
    curved, massive, and decorated main wall. Surveyors having located
    this spot, examinations were made in 1903, with the result that some
    twenty-five phalli, also some sections of phalli, and of carved
    portions of soapstone beams and bowls, were found within 3 ft. of this
    spot on two sides, and all within a few minutes of each other. This is
    by far the largest “find” of phalli ever made at Zimbabwe. At this spot
    Bent also made his largest “find” of phalli, solar discs, and other
    relics. The large soapstone birds were found 3 ft. or 4 ft. further
    south-west of the “altar.” Messrs. Posselt, who resided and farmed at
    Zimbabwe in 1888 and before the Occupation, wished to remove these
    birds, but the previous Mogabe (Chipfuno) refused his consent.</p>

  <p><i>Internal walls.</i>—On the north side of the interior of this temple is
    a wall acting as a retaining wall, with filled-in ground behind it
    forming a terrace. This upper terrace is at the highest point of the
    floor of the temple, and is 16 ft. long, 4 ft. high, and 2 ft. 6 in. on
    the summit. Judging by the amount of débris, this terrace had in all
    probability a parapet wall along its summit. The wall runs from N. 25°
    E. to S. 20° W., and starts from the south side of a huge boulder at 16
    ft. north-west of the <em>North Entrance</em>.</p>

  <p>On the south-west side and at the north-west end of the interior of the
    temple, and corresponding with the first terraced wall just described,
    is another terrace wall 12 ft. long and 3 ft. high, running eastwards
    from the south side of the cliff which forms the north-west side of
    the temple and the south-west side of the passage which runs from the
    <em>Cleft Rock Enclosure</em> to this temple. The two corresponding terraces
    form a junction with an abutment wall projecting south-east for 2 ft. 6
    in. This projection is 2 ft. high and 5 ft. 6 in. wide.</p>

  <p>Immediately in front of this projection on the south-east<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span> side and
    sloping down for some distance towards the lower part of the temple is
    some cement work, which, though old, does not appear to be ancient, for
    it contains splinters of time-worn monoliths which show signs of having
    once stood upon one of the walls. The purpose of this cement projection
    is not clearly seen, for tree roots have easily passed through such
    rough cement and have torn it out of all shape, besides which it has
    become decomposed and soft.</p>

  <p>Between the angle formed by this last-described terraced wall and the
    projection just mentioned is a very rudely cemented floor also much
    decomposed. The few steps leading up from the flooring at this point
    towards the path to the <em>Cleft Rock Enclosure</em> are quite modern, having
    been built by the writer to enable visitors to pass over the débris of
    a large rounded buttress which once stood against the north-west side
    of the nearest boulder. From the top of this débris pile steps of an
    ancient character, and more or less defined, continue up the slope at
    the foot of the south side of the cliff where runs a path towards the
    <em>Cleft Rock Enclosure</em>.</p>

  <p>A second and lower terrace is 4 ft. long and 4 ft. high, and is carried
    on a red cement foundation 18 in. thick. It terminates abruptly on the
    south-west extremity in a broken end. This wall juts out from the south
    side of the north cliff at 15 ft. east of the <em>North Entrance</em>, and
    runs south-west. Immediately behind this wall is a second wall running
    parallel with it, the face of the second or back wall actually touching
    the back of the front wall. This back wall runs south-west for 5 ft.
    beyond the end of the front wall, where it also terminates in a broken
    end. It is 3 ft. high, but in all probability it was once much higher.</p>

  <p>The <em>Balcony Enclosure</em>, which is at the north-west end of the temple
    and is described later, provided another entrance to this temple, the
    <em>Balcony Enclosure</em> being approached from the west and north sides
    respectively by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span> passage through the <em>Balcony Cave</em> and the ascent
    from <em>Rock Holes Path</em>.</p>

  <p>The <em>Ancient Balcony</em> is at the north-west end of the temple, the whole
    interior of which it overlooks, and appears to have acted for this
    temple in the same manner and for the same purposes as <em>The Platform</em>
    of the <em>Western Temple</em> and <em>The Platform</em> in the <em>Elliptical Temple</em>
    in the valley. This <em>Ancient Balcony</em> is described later.</p>

  <p>The interior of this temple has been used by the past and present
    Makalanga as a cattle kraal, and very possibly the cattle have trodden
    any cement work out of shape. It was found to be covered with a thick
    stratum of cattle manure, which again was covered by wall débris, and
    still further by a foot depth of rich vegetable mould thickly matted
    with roots of creepers, shrubs, and trees.</p>

  <h3>THE ANCIENT BALCONY</h3>

  <p>At the north-west end of the <em>Eastern Temple</em>, and at the highest point
    of the interior and immediately behind the higher of the terraced walls
    before described, fourteen steps, eight of granite cement and six of
    blocks, lead for 26 ft. in a north-westerly direction up a passage-way
    formed on the south side by a cliff, and on the north side by two large
    boulders. Each step is 5 in. high and extends back 18 in. The ascending
    passage is 7 ft. wide at its lowest part, and narrows to a creep-hole
    between the cliff and the upper of the two large boulders to just the
    size that will permit of a man passing through by stooping.</p>

  <p>Over this passage are two colossal boulders, held up in a horizontal
    position by the cliff, the level top of the southernmost being 26 ft.
    above the bottom of the steps, which are exactly underneath. The steps
    are laid on cement, and probably are of a late period, at any rate
    there is evidence that they have been very considerably repaired.</p>

  <p>Immediately facing the top of the steps, and 4 ft. above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span> the
    creep-hole, is a rounded buttress projecting from the side of the
    cliff, and measuring 15 ft. in circumference. The highest part faces
    east, and is still 9 ft. 6 in. in height, while the north-west side is
    considerably dilapidated.</p>

  <p>This passage is the approach to the <em>Ancient Balcony</em> and <em>Balcony
    Enclosure</em>. Following up the passage, and turning to the right at the
    top, one ascends a bank with traces of steps between the boulder which
    forms the creep-hole, and a wall on the north, and arrives on the
    <em>Balcony</em>.</p>

  <p>The <em>Balcony</em> is formed by the level and parallel tops of the
    horizontal boulders, and is 39 ft. long, and at its widest part 12 ft.
    10 in. On the south-east side is a parapet wall from 1 to 3 ft. present
    reduced height, and 2 ft. 6 in. wide.</p>

  <p>The <em>Balcony</em> is 248 ft. above the valley, and commands a most
    extensive view to the south-east, including the <em>Elliptical Temple</em> in
    the valley, and the <em>Schlichter Gorge</em>, which extends into a sea of
    romantically shaped summits of kopjes and blue distances. The <em>Balcony</em>
    commands a complete view of the whole of the interior of the <em>Eastern
    Temple</em>.</p>

  <h3>BALCONY ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>The length of this enclosure from north to south is 51 ft., and the
    average width from 15 ft. to 20 ft., the whole of the sides being
    formed by cliff and boulders, except on the north side, where a space
    between two large boulders has been built up by the ancients. This wall
    is 9 ft. long and 11 ft. high.</p>

  <p>The wall extending from the north-east corner of the <em>Balcony</em>, and
    on the north side, except for one short length, is not ancient. Local
    Makalanga state their people of some two or three generations back
    re-erected the wall on the old foundation. This is obviously the fact.
    But an entrance from the <em>North Plateau</em> was once at this point, and
    led down steps on the outside, going west between two large boulders
    zigzag downwards to the <em>Rock Holes Path</em>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span></p>

  <h3>BALCONY CAVE</h3>

  <p>At the west end of this enclosure is a steep descent of 36 ft. between
    two boulders into <em>Balcony Cave</em> formed by a cliff, the east face of
    which beetles over the descent. The cave is 19 ft. wide at the bottom
    and is very much filled in with wall débris, silted soil, and large
    scales of granite off the face of the overhanging rock. This cave
    formed an entrance into the <em>Balcony Enclosure</em> from the <em>Rock Holes
    Path</em>, which runs along the north-west face of the cliff, only on a
    very much lower level. A wall 18 ft. high starts from the bottom of the
    cave and is built across it on the north side, running west to east.
    This wall is partly rounded on the upper portion. At 7 ft. from the
    ground the lower part of this wall has collapsed and blocked up the
    exit. Another wall 8 ft. long and 6 ft. high and in two rising tiers
    crosses from side to side at a higher level. Two almost perfectly
    shaped monoliths, very much weather-worn, were found among the débris
    in this cave.</p>

  <h3>GOLD FURNACE ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>This enclosure is 12 ft. lower than the <em>Eastern Temple</em>, the outer
    face of the eastern main wall for 15 ft. forming its west side. On all
    other sides it is surrounded by cliff and boulders, a continuation of
    the north cliff of the <em>Eastern Temple</em> forming its north side. The
    area is 46 ft. from west to east, and 32 ft. from north to south. At
    the south-west corner is a chasm 14 ft. long, 2 ft. to 5 ft. wide,
    and 11 ft. high running between the front base of the temple wall
    and the west end of the huge boulder, 44 ft. long, which forms the
    southern side of the enclosure. The chasm leads out of the enclosure
    to the south side of the outer wall of the temple. It was once much
    larger, but owing to silting in of soil and débris, and the falling
    of decomposed slabs of granite from its roof, it has become narrowed
    and shallowed. Along the buttress which forms the lower part of the
    east<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span> front of the temple wall was a path from the east entrance of
    the temple to the top of the chasm, which was further arched with
    granite slabs making a wider bridge, and this led to the floor of
    this enclosure by means of steps which ran down the north face of the
    boulder on the south-west side of the enclosure.</p>

  <p>It was in this enclosure that Bent believed he had discovered ancient
    gold furnaces. At the south-east corner is an open space 9 ft. wide,
    which once had a rounded buttress on either side. Beyond this point the
    ground falls rapidly to the south towards the edge of the precipice.
    Under the cliff are holes hardly deep enough to be termed caves, and
    these have been reduced in size by the silting in of soil.</p>

  <h3>UPPER GOLD FURNACE ENCLOSURE</h3>

  <p>This is situated at the north-east corner of the <em>Gold Furnace
    Enclosure</em>, but on a level of 4 ft. higher. Separating the two
    enclosures is a well-built wall 10 ft. long with a rounded entrance in
    the centre.</p>

  <p>The greatest width of this enclosure is 9 ft. at the entrance, and its
    length is 44 ft., but it is very narrow except for about 12 ft. in the
    middle of the length. The south end runs between and under boulders,
    while the north end includes a cave under the continuation of the cliff
    which forms the north sides of the <em>Eastern Temple</em> and the <em>Gold
    Furnace Enclosure</em>. This cave has also been reduced in size by the
    filling in of débris and soil.</p>

  <h3>PATTERN PASSAGE</h3>

  <p>This passage runs for 51 ft. along the outside of the south and
    south-west portion of the curved main wall of the <em>Eastern Temple</em>.
    In the south-west portion the passage is 2 ft. wide, and formerly its
    floor throughout this section was level with that of the present floor
    of <em>Recess Enclosure</em>, but a large boulder at the west entrance to the
    <em>Eastern Temple</em> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>having slipped and disturbed the entrance walls,
    steps have recently been erected to enable visitors to climb over the
    débris heap.</p>

  <p>On the west side of the northern length of the passage the wall is 11
    ft. high, the upper portion receding from the passage at 8 ft. above
    the level of the floor at the foot of the newly-erected steps, and
    in the recess so formed is what appears to be a decorative pattern
    of original form made of rows of blocks, each row at the back of the
    other, and rising backwards in miniature steps or shelves. But these
    rows are not believed to have been intended or used as steps, as the
    lines of blocks on either side round off to come flush with the face
    of the wall and become part of the wall at each end, and are continued
    as ordinary courses in the faces of the wall. The exact correctness
    of these step-like rows and curves of blocks is remarkable. For the
    present, and until the purpose of these steps can be ascertained, this
    feature is called <em>Step Pattern</em>. It has been suggested that these
    steps must have formed a post for a guard to protect the <em>Western
    Entrance</em> to the temple.</p>

  <p>The wall opposite the approach to <em>Pattern Passage</em> from <em>Recess
    Enclosure</em> is 8 ft. high, and rises to 17 ft., as the floor of the
    southern section of the passage descends somewhat sharply. The southern
    section terminates at the rounded end of the east wall of <em>Recess
    Enclosure</em>, which here is rather a fine piece of dry masonry. Formerly
    this section had steps let into the wall on either side, fragments of
    such stones still projecting from the walls, the foundations of which
    have been laid bare, and at one point undermined. This vandalism is not
    the work of archæologists, but of unauthorised prospectors for gold
    relics, who have torn up the whole length of stairs and pavement, not
    only in this passage, but in every other passage on the hill which was
    not protected by being filled in with wall débris.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span></p>

  <h3>RECESS ENCLOSURE<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></h3>

  <p>This is an almost complete enclosure on the south side of the <em>Eastern
    Temple</em>, and separated from it by a deep and narrow passage, now known
    as <em>Pattern Passage</em>. Formerly a passage-way ran along the west side of
    the enclosure from north to south. The area of this enclosure is—south
    side, 17 ft. 6 in., north side 18 ft., west side 25 ft., and east side
    20 ft. The surface shows signs of the enclosure having been filled in
    above its original floor by some later occupiers. The south wall has
    collapsed except for about 4 ft. at its west end, and this section is 8
    ft. high, but the foundations of the rest of this wall are practically
    intact. The north wall is considerably broken, its highest point being
    now only 5 ft. above the present floor. The west wall, which is intact,
    is formed by the outer wall of a building erected at a much higher
    level, called <em>South Enclosure C</em>. This wall is 22 ft. high, and is in
    two parts—the upper part being rounded outwards at the extremities, and
    the centre rounded inwards. This wall is exceedingly well built, and
    is one of the finest pieces of masonry to be seen on the <em>Acropolis</em>,
    and shows very great architectural skill on the part of the ancient
    builders.</p>

  <p>The south wall is now only 8 ft. to 9 ft., and on the inside face
    has a row of five vertical recesses built in the wall and flush with
    its face. These are altogether unlike anything yet discovered in any
    ancient ruins,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> except, perhaps, at <em>No. 1 Ruin</em> at <em>Khami</em>. The
    widths of the faces of the wall between the recesses from north to
    south are 2 ft. 4 in., 1 ft. 9 in., 1 ft. 10 in., 1 ft. 7 in., and 1
    ft. 8 in., and these are separated from each other by perpendicular
    crevices, each <span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>5 in. wide. Most probably the recesses were once
    considerably higher. What practical purpose they could have served is
    at present impossible to state, but it has always been held that they
    probably once contained wooden beams.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The north-west entrance has rounded walls, and from the east side
    of this entrance are the remains of a passage wall running south.
    This wall is 6 ft. long, 2 ft. 6 in. high, and 2 ft. 6 in. wide; the
    foundations of this wall run almost as far as the south wall of the
    enclosure.</p>

  <p>All the walls of this enclosure are well built.</p>

  <p>In the north-east corner is an excavated hole, showing a wall running
    parallel to the east wall at a depth lower than the present floor of
    the enclosure. The north end of the east wall is beautifully rounded
    and tapers from its base to present summit, its face forming the south
    side of the east end of <em>Pattern Passage</em>.</p>

  <h3>NORTH PLATEAU</h3>

  <p>This plateau is situated to the north of the <em>Eastern Temple</em> and at
    the north of the cliffs, which form its north-east and north sides.
    Its shape is that of a quarter of a circle—the east side being formed
    by cliffs running towards the north-east, and the south side by huge
    boulders running out towards the north-west, the apex being at the
    north end of the <em>North Passage</em> of the <em>Eastern Temple</em>. The area from
    north to south is 67 ft., and from east to west 53 ft., the outer and
    open side being supported by a terrace wall extending along the front
    for 43 ft. This terraced wall is well built for this length. It has
    a drop from the outer surface edge of this plateau of 11 ft. Traces
    of a continuation of this wall across the gorge on the north side on
    to the opposite shoulder of the kopje can be seen; but the Makalanga
    state that the superstructure built upon these traces was made by their
    people long ago, and, indeed, this is very obvious. A Makalanga-built
    wall juts out from the north-east side a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span> few feet towards the
    <em>Visitors’ Path</em> to this plateau. The plateau is covered with the clay
    foundations of the circular huts of the Makalanga, who up to four years
    ago had their kraal on the northern summit of the hill.</p>

  <h3>NORTH PARAPET</h3>

  <p>This structure is at the outer and northern base of the large curved
    main wall of the <em>Western Temple</em>, on which are the small towers and
    monoliths, where it curves towards the north-east and runs parallel
    with it for 44 ft. In this parapet is a rising passage with steps
    leading from the <em>North-West Ancient Ascent</em> up to the main wall, where
    it once passed through it and curved into <em>Platform Enclosure</em> where it
    can still be walked along. The point where this passage went through
    the main wall has been blocked up by the Makalanga, and the wall is
    so very dilapidated that it would be altogether unsafe to clear the
    entrance of the obstructing blocks.</p>

  <p>The parapet was evidently once more extended towards the east, but the
    fall of débris from the broken end of the main wall has carried the
    parapet below away.</p>

  <p>The western extremity of this parapet is formed by a wall 11 ft. long
    projecting at right angles from the foot of the main wall. This wall
    is 8 ft. high and is 4 ft. wide on its present reduced summit. From
    opposite the north end of this wall commences the west side wall of the
    ancient ascent described later.</p>

  <p>Immediately on the east side of the wall forming the western extremity
    of the parapet there are steps rising 3 ft. 6 in. facing north and
    leading up to the sunken passage on the parapet, and above these steps
    the passage turns east at right angles along the centre of the parapet.</p>

  <p>The width of the parapet is 11 ft., and this width is divided as
    follows: width of passage 3 ft., of outer parapet wall 4 ft., and of
    inner wall 3 ft. 6 in. The passage rises 8 ft. between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span> where it enters
    the <em>North Parapet</em> and where it rounds off towards the south-east
    through the main wall. The outer and inner walls are 3 ft. to 4 ft.
    above the passage floor, but the outer wall was probably once very much
    higher. There are traces of steps in the passage.</p>

  <p>The height of the north face of the <em>North Parapet</em> from above the
    filled-in floor on the outside is from 9 ft. to 11 ft. This floor
    contains the remains of a rather old Makalanga hut.</p>

  <p>A parapet wall of a similar character runs from the western end of
    <em>North Parapet</em> along the outer base of the main wall, and this is
    described later under the title of <em>Western Parapet</em>.</p>

    South Face of Zimbabwe Hill—Outspan Ruins.</div>

  <h3>NORTH-WEST ANCIENT ASCENT</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap">UNFORTUNATELY in describing this ascent it is necessary to commence at
    the summit and work downwards instead of upwards. The amount of débris
    which covered its lower lengths precluded the tracing of the ascent
    from below, and further it is only the higher lengths which have been
    cleared out, though now the lower parts can be easily followed.</p>

  <p>The ascent begins at the <em>Water Gate</em> at the north-west base of the
    hill, and terminates at <em>The Platform</em> which overlooks the <em>Eastern
    Temple</em> on the Acropolis. Its total length is a little more than 500 ft.</p>

  <p>Walking across the north-west face of the hill it would have been
    impossible to discover this ascent owing to the confusing number of
    lines of foundations and outcrops of walls running in all directions
    over the side of the hill, and the intermediate ground being so much
    covered with blocks. The idea that this ascent existed along its
    present lines was suggested by viewing the face of the hill from
    Mogabe’s kraal, which is on the opposite side of the north-west valley.
    From this point the step-like form of the side of the hill can be seen
    as a whole, and it appears obvious that artificial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span> means had been
    employed in making the lines of projection on the side of the hill.
    These were subsequently examined, with the result that sections of a
    passage-way downwards were found in one chain extending from the summit
    to the base of the hill, though there were some long gaps between the
    sections, while the sections themselves were filled in up to where the
    side walls out-cropped for a few inches.</p>

  <p>The sections of this ancient ascent, commencing at the summit, are as
    follows:—</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) Passage through <em>Platform Enclosure</em> 72 ft. long (see <em>Platform
    Enclosure</em>).</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) Passage through main wall 16 ft. long (do.).</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) Passage along <em>Northern Parapet</em> 28 ft. long (see <em>Northern
    Parapet</em>).</p>

  <p>(<i>d</i>) Section of ascent between <em>Northern Parapet</em> and the old
    visitors’ path which the ascent crosses 233 ft. long.</p>

  <p>(<i>e</i>) Section between Visitors’ Path and the <em>Water Gate</em>, which is at
    the lowest point of the ascent, over 600 ft. long.</p>

  <p>(<i>f</i>) <em>Water Gate</em> (see <em>Water Gate</em>).</p>

  <p>The first three sections have already been described.</p>

  <p><i>Section (d).</i>—This extends from the <em>Northern Parapet</em> to the old
    visitors’ path. The passage on leaving the parapet turns north-west
    for 41 ft. The walls on either side are from 3 ft. to 5 ft. high, but
    these heights are increased on either side by a further 2 ft. or 3 ft.,
    owing to the depth of soil and block débris lying along the summits of
    the side walls, the passage for this length being found buried for this
    depth below the surface of the face of the hill. This length of passage
    is 2 ft. to 3 ft. in width. At 31 ft. from the upper end of this length
    and on the east side is a rounded entrance leading into an enclosure
    which is completely buried under débris and silted soil.</p>

  <p>At the bottom end of this length of 41 ft. the passage turns due east
    for 32 ft., the corner wall being rounded. At this corner a passage
    from the west side enters the ascent, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span> this passage is at present
    buried in débris. The width of the ascent here averages 4 ft. to 5 ft.
    6 in., but it is narrowed at one point to 2 ft. 6 in. by a rounded
    buttress projecting from the north side into the ascent. The heights
    of the walls for this length are: south side 6 ft. to 8 ft., with
    several feet depth of débris on its summit; north side 4 ft. to 8 ft.
    The ascent in this length has a fall of 6 ft. At the bottom of this
    length on the south side, and fronting up the ascent, is a rounded
    buttress in form of a quarter section of a circle, and this is 11 ft.
    round its base. It has a further buttress on its west side and traces
    of another on its east side, and between these two buttresses are the
    remains of steps, but a tree growing out of the steps has caused their
    dilapidation.</p>

  <p>From this buttress the passage turns due north for 75 ft.; its eastern
    side from 28 ft. to 56 ft. of this length had fallen into the passage,
    but the rest of that side of the passage is still practically intact.
    Along this length the passage is deeply sunk into the face of the hill.
    The widths average from 2 ft. 10 in. to 6 ft. The side walls are of
    the following heights above the passage floor: east side, 7 ft. to
    10 ft.; west side, 5 ft. to 10 ft. On either side of this length are
    enclosures which are completely filled in with débris and buried, but
    the entrances to these can be seen. This length of passage was found
    (October, 1902) to be completely buried, even for some feet above the
    10 ft. side walls, and the floors of Makalanga huts were built across
    them and the passage.</p>

  <p>At the 63 ft. point in this length are two entrances, one on either
    side of the passage. The one on the east side is rounded and is 6 ft.
    high, and steps are formed by the curving inwards of the courses of the
    wall. This leads into an enclosure until recently filled in and buried,
    and this enclosure is mentioned in the description of the <em>North-West
      Face of Zimbabwe Hill</em>, where it is described as being typical of so
    many other enclosures on this side of the hill. On the opposite side of
    the passage the entrance there is angular on <span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>one side and rounded on
    the other. Its side walls are 6 ft. high. This entrance is blocked up
    in the same manner as was the ascent. This leads into another buried
    enclosure, a portion of which has been cleared out and examined. The
    passage along the 75 ft. length has a fall of 11 ft.</p>

    <div class="caption">HERRING-BONE PATTERN, WATER GATE RUINS, ZIMBABWE</div>
  </div>

  <p>At the bottom end of this length and going north is an enclosed area
    triangular in shape 47 ft. long, and with the apex resting in the lower
    end, where the passage becomes narrowed to 2 ft. 6 in. This area and
    the corresponding area of similar shape in the <em>South-East Ancient
      Ascent</em> appear to have been intended to serve a similar purpose—that
    is, to enable a crowd of defenders on a high level to act against two
    or three bands of the attacking party on a lower level and in a narrow
    passage. Into this area open out at least three entrances from buried
    enclosures on either side. The area has in its length a fall of 9 ft.</p>

  <p>At the foot of this triangular-shaped area the passage runs north for
    38 ft. It is 2 ft. to 4 ft. wide, and the side walls are 4 ft. high.
    The fall in this length is 5 ft. At the northern end of this length and
    crossing it at right angles is the old path used by visitors in making
    the ascent of the hill.</p>

  <p><i>Section (e).</i>—This extends from the old path used by visitors
    ascending the hill, down to the <em>Water Gate</em>.</p>

  <p>From the Visitors’ Path the descent to the <em>Water Gate</em> is somewhat
    uninteresting, the passage walls being very much dilapidated, the
    upper side wall being particularly damaged, having been subject to the
    full force of falls of block débris down the face of the hill. In this
    way the lower side walls, having been so protected, are in a somewhat
    better condition.</p>

  <p>Starting down from the path there appears to be a chaos of stones
    for some 15 ft., but still the passage can be traced. As there are
    several lines of well-laid blocks close to the crossing of the path
    and passage, it is quite probable that side passages ran into the main
    passage at this point. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span> the 15 ft. down a very wide wall 4 ft. to 5
    ft. high runs down the north side of the passage for 140 ft.</p>

  <p>The south side shows an unburied wall 30 ft. long and about 3 ft.
    high. At 80 ft. from the Visitors’ Path the passage opens out into
    a triangular space 25 ft. wide, with the apex resting at the lowest
    point of the steep enclosure. Such triangular spaces on the lines of
    steep passages are not uncommon, being found at several ruins. There is
    one higher up the same ascent, and another on the South-East Ancient
    Ascent. In each case the descent is steep, and the lowest point of the
    triangular area rests on a narrow passage coming up from below.</p>

  <p>At 140 ft. below the Visitors’ Path the north wall alone is standing,
    and this runs downwards for 50 ft. This wall is 4 ft. high and is
    rather wide. The south wall is now represented only by a line of wall
    débris running parallel with the north wall.</p>

  <p>At 190 ft. the passage becomes lost, but exactly parallel and at a
    distance of 20 ft. south is the commencement of another passage.
    Probably the upper length takes a sharp turn west under a pile of
    débris which lies between the two passages. This second passage has a
    buried wall 3 ft. high on the south side. On the north side the wall
    is 150 ft. long, and on this length the south wall has practically
    disappeared.</p>

  <p>At the down side of this length the passage becomes far better defined,
    having side walls from 3 ft. to 5 ft. high, and 3 ft. wide on their
    summits. The passage here takes a sharp turn towards the north for 50
    ft., then to the south-west for 25 ft., and again to the north for
    almost 100 ft., the side walls being intact for this length, the east
    wall being from 4 ft. to 7 ft. high, and the passage 2 ft. 6 in. wide.
    This is the best-preserved portion of the lower half of the <em>Ascent</em>.
    The west side walls are from 3 ft. to 4 ft. high. Between these walls
    are traces of steps, also a few buttresses, all rounded.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span></p>

  <p>At the end of this length the passage is continued between walls 4
    ft. high to its extremity, before reaching which it takes some sharp
    W-shaped turns and terminates in very well-built walls.</p>

  <p>The <em>Water Gate</em> faces this point at 100 ft. distance, only at a lower
    level of some 30 ft. to 40 ft. The side of the hill is here very
    steep, and is faced in parts with granite glacis, between which the
    path descended to the <em>Water Gate</em>. Converging on the extremity of the
    passage are traces of other passages from each side, which give the
    impression that the <em>North-West Ascent</em> was the main approach to the
    summit of the <em>Acropolis</em> from this side of the hill.</p>

  <h3>THE WATER GATE RUINS</h3>

  <p>This is situated at the lowest extremity of the North-West Ancient
    Ascent to the Acropolis, and forms its approach and entrance from the
    valley on the west and north sides of Zimbabwe Hill. It has been styled
    the Water Gate on account of there being immediately in front of it a
    large donga (water-hole), one of the chain of dongas which run round
    the hill from the south-west to the north-east, and are believed to be
    artificial, but have become reduced from the original area and depth
    by the silting in from the side of the hill during a very long period
    of sub-tropical rains. Sections of walls have been discovered at great
    depth in these dongas.</p>

  <p>This entrance forms part of a long line of wall which runs round the
    base of the hill for some two or three hundred yards, and is called
    the Inner Defence Wall, in which on the south-west side of the hill is
    another large entrance, known as the Outspan Ruins. This line of wall
    is in some places very well defined, being from 2 ft. to 4 ft. above
    the level of the veld, but some lengths of it are mere lines of stone
    débris or ridges of mounds full of blocks; but seen from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span> some heights
    up the face of the opposite hill it can be traced throughout its length.</p>

  <p>The gateway is exceedingly well constructed, and the curves of the ends
    of the walls which form its sides are very bold and massive. Though
    it is distant over 900 ft. from the main ruins on the summit of the
    hill, it must be admitted to be a very good example of entrances of the
    earliest ancient period. But the construction of the wall on either
    side of this entrance, and at some little distance from it, becomes
    only fairly good, and at a still greater distance roughly built, and
    yet the entrance and the line of wall are of the same original plan.
    This grading off of the quality of construction on either side of the
    entrance and at some little distance from it is also seen in many
    other entrances which are not in proximity to the main ruins. The line
    of the Inner Defence Wall in which this entrance is inserted curves
    outwards towards the west-north-west from about 30 ft. on either side
    of it. The entrance is thus in the centre of the curve, and faces
    west-north-west. It is 2 ft. 10 in. wide, and 7 ft. from outside to
    inside. The side wall on the south is 7 ft. 6 in. high above the steps,
    and on the north 5 ft. 6 in., though on either side the present reduced
    summit of the wall is from 2 ft. to 4 ft. higher at a few feet from the
    entrance. Like all main entrances, save one, at Zimbabwe, it is without
    portcullis grooves, these having been found in rounded entrances in
    internal and divisional walls. The wall on the south side is 8 ft. wide
    on the floor of the entrance, and 7 ft. 6 in. on the north side. There
    are remains of three steps on the entrance which commence flush with
    the front faces of the two side walls. These are greatly dilapidated,
    but it can be seen that they form part of the foundations of the wall.
    One stone of what is left in the front row is considerably worn on the
    top, as if it had been trodden on for many generations.</p>

  <p>As in very many entrances of the earliest style of ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
    architecture—for instance, the main entrance to the Elliptical
    Temple—the walls on either side widen out as they approach the
    entrance. In this instance the walls widen out from 4 ft. and 5 ft. to
    8 ft. as the entrance is neared. There are also traces of buttresses
    on either hand on the inner sides of the entrance, also of a few steps
    ascending into the interior of the enclosed area.</p>

  <p>The front face of the wall on the north side is 5 ft. above the veld,
    but the summit increases in height towards the interior face of the
    wall, as most of the dilapidations have taken place on the outer side
    of the wall. The front face of the south wall is 7 ft. in height, and
    the summit of this wall ascends much higher towards its inner face.
    At 12 ft. from the entrance, along the face of the south wall, it is
    clearly seen where the excellent workmanship of the entrance grades off
    to an inferior construction in the continuation of the wall southwards.
    The line of wall on the south side is more or less intact for 48 ft.,
    at which point it becomes lost in débris and silted soil, though its
    line of route can of course be traced much further. The wall on the
    north side extends for 90 ft., but from this point northward it is very
    easy to follow the course of its débris.</p>

  <p>The interior faces of the wall, for about 30 ft. on either side of the
    entrance, are still in a good condition, and are from 4 ft. to 7 ft.
    above the inside cleared-out level.</p>

  <p>On the inner face of the south wall, at 5 ft. above the present level
    of the enclosed area, is a herring-bone pattern which directly faces
    east-south-east. The pattern remaining is 3 ft. 6 in. long, and 1 ft.
    2 in. deep, and is formed of tile-like blocks, varying from 10 in.
    to 1 ft. 3 in. in length. Judging by the positions of the stones, it
    is highly probable that this pattern extends at least 2 ft. further
    towards the entrance. The usual frame for this pattern, and also for
    Dentelle and Chevron Patterns, is still good for three courses at its
    south end. The size of the stones employed in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span> pattern is above
    the average size used for the same pattern in other ruins, and is
    somewhat larger than those in the pattern at Little Umnukwana Ruins, in
    the M’Pateni district, where the average length of the stones is 10 in.
    So far this is the only herring-bone pattern discovered at Zimbabwe. It
    was first noticed by Mr. J. W. Clarke, of Victoria, in September, 1902.</p>

  <p>From immediately behind this entrance the north-west face of the hills
    rises very sharply, so much so that the rains of many years have silted
    soil to a great depth behind the walls. Rain-water would naturally be
    guided by the contour of this part of the hill towards this entrance,
    so that the area behind it has become filled up to a very much higher
    level than in the time of the original occupiers. Some two dozen cubic
    feet of this silted soil was cleared out of the entrance in October,
    1902, and while the work was progressing a heavy storm, lasting only an
    hour, broke over Zimbabwe. On visiting the entrance later in the day it
    was found that this one shower had caused the almost entire filling up
    of the excavation by mud streams, which had washed down the side of the
    hill.</p>

  <p>Immediately in front of the outer faces of this entrance and running
    parallel with this length of the Inner Defence Wall, and at a distance
    of 90 ft. from it, are the remains of a line of wall almost hidden in
    débris. This wall can be traced for a distance of at least 130 ft.,
    and there appears to have been a passage or entrance through it at a
    point almost due north of the Water Gate. Further to the north and
    north-west of this wall is a donga, and on the north-north-west of this
    donga runs the outer defence wall, which is at least 600 yds. long, and
    encloses the line of dongas from west of the Elliptical Temple with the
    north-east of the base of Zimbabwe Hill. In this Outer Defence Wall
    is an opening, and in all probability, judging by the arrangement of
    the wall débris and the contour of the ground, a gateway or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span> entrance
    was once situated at this point. This opening in the Outer Defence
    Wall, the traces of an entrance in the ruined wall in front of the
    Water Gate, and the Water Gate entrance are all in one line, and the
    line is further made complete by the remains of two small walls in
    the donga itself, which equally divide its width, as if these walls
    either carried or supported a bridge; or at any rate afforded the means
    for crossing the donga. In fact, the size of these dongas and their
    relative positions appear to indicate that on this side of the hill the
    Acropolis was further defended by water. These two small walls show
    signs of having had rounded entrances in their centres.</p>

  <p>Taking into consideration the line of the three entrances, the fact
    that the ancient ascent through the Water Gate leads into the heart
    of the main ruins of the Acropolis, and further that the contour of
    the ground beyond the Outer Defence Wall indicates the direction in
    which a road from Zimbabwe to the north and north-west must take, it
    is reasonable to conjecture that the ancient road from Zimbabwe in
    that direction passed on the north side of the Makuma Kopje, on which
    Mogabe’s kraal is now located.</p>

  <h3>TERRACED ENCLOSURES ON NORTH-WEST FACE OF ZIMBABWE HILL</h3>

  <p>About forty or fifty ledges protrude in step form up the north-west
    face of Zimbabwe Hill from the valley below up to the front of the west
    main wall of the <em>Western Temple</em>, and these projections are not only
    upwards in terrace form, but broadways, extending across the entire
    length of the north-west face of the hill.</p>

  <p>The best view of these ledges is obtained from <em>Makuma Kopje</em>, on which
    is Mogabe’s kraal. From this point it is seen that these projections
    must have been artificially made. So great has been the fall of
    wall débris, and the washing of soil for many centuries by heavy
    sub-tropical rains down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span> hillside, that even the outer faces, or
    retaining walls, of many of these projecting ledges or platforms are
    completely buried, and their outline can but barely be traced owing to
    the absence of any outcrop of walls. In fact, the whole of this face of
    the hill for over 300 yds. upwards, and the same distance broadways, is
    but a chaos of fallen blocks, and the visitor, while walking over this
    area, sees infinitely less of their arrangement and plan than can be
    seen at a distance of a third of a mile from the opposite kopje.</p>

  <p>These terraces are not disposed in lines across the hill as are the
    <em>Hill Terraces</em> of <em>Inyanga</em>, but each is independent of the other.
    Nor do they in any point resemble the terrace system of the retaining
    walls so often met with in ruins of the Second Period of Zimbabwe
    architecture.</p>

  <p>Several of these projecting areas on the steep face of the hill have
    recently been cleared of the débris which has in so many instances
    completely covered them, and rendered their form but a mere suggestion
    of an outline. The outer faces of some of the terrace walls have been
    laid bare, and their construction is seen to be of true Zimbabwe
    building of the First Period, all features of the Second Period, so far
    as examinations have extended, being altogether absent.</p>

  <p>The walls are not built on straight lines but on curves, some of the
    curves being laid on bold lines, in some instances amounting to a
    semi-circle. The angular wall is absent. The construction of most of
    the walls is superior to that of Second Period walls. There is no
    promiscuous filling-up of the interiors of the walls. The walls are as
    well built on the inside as they are on their outside faces, and they
    possess the true Zimbabwe batter-back, and such entrances as have been
    discovered are excellently rounded.</p>

  <p>The spaces between the outside edge of the summits of these walls in
    front and the rising surface of the hill behind them have been levelled
    by falling débris, but there is no lack of evidence to show that, where
    not wholly filled in naturally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span> in the course of time, the work of
    their complete filling-in has been systematically carried out by people
    who were not the original builders. On clearing the irregular surfaces
    of these ledges of débris it was found that the areas were rudely
    covered with red clay or <i>daka</i>, and on this flooring were the clay
    foundations of Makalanga huts, with piles of buck bones and quantities
    of charcoal and bits of iron slag. Mogabe’s headmen state that these
    hut foundations are not those of Makalanga of their time, as Mogabe’s
    kraal, and that of Mokomo before him, though on the north side of the
    hill, were situated much higher up the hill and much nearer to, or even
    among, the main ruins. Nor do they belong to Makalanga of sixty years
    ago, for Mogabe’s people say that when Chipfuno arrived as a boy some
    seventy years ago this portion of the hill was then in the same state
    as is seen to-day. Judging by the weathered blocks piled and strewn
    upon these areas, it is very possible that these rough clay floors and
    hut foundations are at least seventy years old, if not considerably
    older. Portions of iron assegais and Makalanga hoes found on these
    floors are so eaten by rust that they have become thin, and are almost
    as brittle as glass.</p>

  <p>But the most interesting feature of these terraced areas lies in the
    fact, obvious to anyone who inspects the areas cleared out in July
    and August, 1902, that these areas were not originally terraces but
    ordinary enclosures, with floors from 4 ft. to 10 ft. lower than the
    present reduced summits of the outer walls. Some people of times
    later than those of the original builders had deliberately taken the
    blocks from the outer or down-side walls of the enclosures and thrown
    them inside till the interiors were filled up level with the reduced
    height of the walls, and over such filling-in had spread a clay floor,
    and so made these enclosures into terraced platforms and dry vantage
    ground on which to build their huts, lay their corn-drying, threshing,
    and winnowing floors, and also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span> their small <i>daka</i> granaries, which,
    occupying these well-drained and soilless positions, would be free from
    the ravages of white ants.</p>

  <p>By clearing the outer faces of these walls from block débris, which
    has fallen or rolled down from higher positions on the hill—and these
    falls have in some instances utterly ruined the walls beneath—and
    following the curve of wall round to its opposite side on the face of
    the hill, the rounded entrances into some of these enclosures have been
    unburied, the floor of such entrances being on an average 5 ft. to 9
    ft. below the débris. These entrances, so far as discoveries have been
    made, are all at the rear of the enclosure and close to the face of the
    hill. These entrances are narrow, 1 ft. 10 in. and 2 ft. 2 in. being a
    fair average width, and once the line of floor which is level with the
    floor of the entrances is cleared, it is seen that there are no steps
    inside the enclosures, though outside the entrances there are in a
    few instances steps leading up to the entrances only, but never steps
    leading upwards from inside the entrances. The floor of the entrance,
    in each case, is the level of the floor of the enclosure. Inside is
    seen a mass of dry blocks without soil, and many of these blocks show a
    face that was once exposed to the weather and become time-eaten if not
    greatly decomposed, which shows that they once formed part of the face
    of an ancient wall.</p>

  <p>In removing this block débris from these enclosures no pick or spade
    was necessary. The blocks were picked up and handed outside, and when
    the enclosures had been emptied there was not 12 in. depth of soil, and
    what was there was mainly fine granite chippings caused by the throwing
    in of the blocks, and of decomposed <i>daka</i>, which had formed the floor,
    and which, being of poor quality, constant rainfalls had practically
    rotted into sand. It was on these cleared-out floors that portions
    of large carved soapstone bowls were discovered in July and August,
    1902. The “finds” on the bottom and original floors bore undoubted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
    evidences of antiquity, and were totally different in character from
    the unmistakable Makalanga objects found on the <i>daka</i> floor some feet
    above.</p>

  <p>As before stated, these terraces of enclosures are in some points
    independent of each other—that is, they extend across the face of the
    hill most irregularly. The second enclosure may be 20 ft. or 30 ft. in
    front of the level of its neighbour on either hand, the third 20 ft.
    or 30 ft. to the rear of the level of the first enclosure, and so on.
    But the enclosures are built very nearly one behind the other up the
    face of the hill, the front wall of one being the back wall of the next
    below. Between these ascending lines of enclosures are narrow sunken
    passages, the existence of which, until August, 1902, was altogether
    unsuspected, as such passages showed no outcrop of their side walls.
    Two of these passages are now known to be at least 350 ft. long, and
    one of them has been cleared out for this length. They were exceedingly
    narrow, so that at many points only one person could pass at a time.
    The widths average 2 ft., and their floors are from 3 ft. to 12 ft.
    below the present débris-strewn surface of the slope of the hill. Into
    these passages the entrances to enclosures on either side open.</p>

  <p>Evidently the same people who filled in the enclosures and converted
    them into platforms likewise deliberately filled in the passages for
    the foundations of old Makalanga huts, and granaries were laid across
    the filled-in passages. The “finds” on the floors of these passages and
    those found on their “filled-in” tops showed as great differences in
    every respect as were presented by the objects found on the original
    floors of the enclosures and those on the later clay floors above them.</p>

  <h3>SOUTH TERRACE</h3>

  <p>This is a natural ledge of ground artificially improved, running east
    at the foot of the south precipice for 200 yards from the foot of the
    <em>Rock Passage</em>, and extending beyond the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span> point where the most easterly
    ruins of the Acropolis are built along the summit cliff. This terrace
    is supported on its south side by several retaining walls.</p>

  <p>Almost all the enclosure walls along this terrace have been demolished
    by the falls of great masses of walls from the ruins on the summit of
    the cliff. Barely the foundations of such enclosure walls now remain,
    the only exception being the enclosure adjoining the bottom end of the
    <em>Rock Passage</em>.</p>

  <h3>THE “OUTSPAN RUINS”</h3>

  <p>These ruins, which lie 75 yds. to the north of Havilah Camp, are on the
    outspan in the valley which runs along the south side of Zimbabwe Hill,
    and also on the path leading from the camp to the South-East Ancient
    Ascent. This block of ruins was entirely cleared out of wall débris and
    silted soil in September, 1902, and now visitors may walk upon what was
    practically the ancient floor. The cement which once formed the floor
    has become decomposed to granite sand, and owing to the enclosures of
    the ruin having been buried some 3 ft. to 5 ft. under the veld, the
    enclosures held all the water which in rainy seasons would pour down
    the side of the hill immediately behind.</p>

  <p>These ruins form part of the line of Hill Inner Defence Wall, which
    encloses the whole of Zimbabwe Hill on its west, south, and east sides
    and runs along the foot of the lower slopes of the hill. The most
    complete view of this continuous line of wall is obtained from the
    summit of the hill. This line of defence wall is again enclosed on the
    west side by the Outer Defence Wall, which runs from the north side of
    the hill almost as far as the Elliptical Temple, and between these two
    walls are the three large dongas on the west side of the hill.</p>

  <p>The “Outspan Ruins” form the most perfect section of the Hill Inner
    Defence Wall, not excepting the fine entrances to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span> the North-West
    Ancient Ascent with its herring-bone pattern, which is also another
    section of the same line of inner defence wall, only on the north-west
    side of the hill. They also must have served as an important entrance
    through the south-west portion of the Hill Inner Defence Wall. The
    entrance is complicated and rendered very difficult of attack by a
    number of rounded buttresses, in addition to which there are small
    enclosures most substantially built, which, most probably, were
    guard-rooms.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_359">
    <img src="images/i_359.jpg" width="600" height="373" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Sketch Plan<br />OUTSPAN RUINS<br />Zimbabwe </div>
  </div>

  <p>There is nothing angular in the plan and construction of these ruins.
    They very patently resemble other outlying buildings which obviously
    formed part of the original plan of the main Hill Ruins. The courses
    in the wall are not very regular, and stones of all shapes and sizes
    have been introduced. There is no decorative pattern in this section
    of the Hill Inner Defence Wall, but there is one peculiarity in its
    architecture, and in that of a conical tower which is described later.</p>

  <p>These ruins occupy an area of 113 ft. from south-east to north-west,
    and 70 ft. from north-east to south-west.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span></p>

  <p>The main wall faces south. The 113 ft. length only includes the line of
    main wall which still stands some 5 ft. to 11 ft. in height, the wall
    at either end of this length can be traced extending for 500 yds. to
    the east and 350 yds. to the west and north.</p>

  <p>The entrance which has rounded walls on either side is 4 ft. wide, and
    passes diagonally south-west through the main wall, thus giving it a
    length of 8 ft. On its eastern side the wall is 7 ft. high, and 5 ft.
    on the western side.</p>

  <p>The ruins on the north side of main wall form a central enclosure to
    the north of the entrance with an enclosure on either side of it, also
    a passage on the south and west sides of the central enclosure.</p>

  <p>The central enclosure is formed by a wall 22 ft. long, 4 ft. high, and
    5 ft. to 7 ft. wide on the present reduced summit, which runs north at
    right angles from the inside of the main wall at 4 ft. east from the
    east side of the entrance. The wall, which at its northern extremity
    is rounded, forms the divisional wall between the central and eastern
    enclosures. The west side of the central enclosure is formed by a wall,
    rounded at each end, which starts at 4 ft. from opposite the inside of
    the entrance, and goes west for 13 ft. and north-east for 19 ft. This
    wall averages 3 ft. to 8 ft. in height, and is from 4 ft. to 5 ft. 6
    in. wide at base, and 3 ft. 6 in. on the highest summit. Where the east
    wall of this enclosure comes opposite the end of the north-east wall is
    an entrance 3 ft. 6 in. wide. The area of this enclosure is 14 ft. from
    west to east and 19 ft. from north to south. It is possible that in the
    centre of this enclosure once stood a round buttress or tower, and the
    position of a few blocks in the floor makes this something more than a
    mere conjecture.</p>

  <p>On passing through the main entrance from the south, one enters a
    passage which runs parallel with the north side of the main wall
    for 17 ft. towards the west, and then curves sharply towards the
    east-north-east for 19 ft. At its two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span> extremities the passage is from
    3 ft. to 3 ft. 6 in. wide, but at the curve at the end of the first
    length of 17 ft. it is 6 ft. wide. The western wall of this passage is
    19 ft. long, 5 ft. wide at base, and 3 ft. 6 in. on the highest portion
    of the summit, this being at the south end, where the wall is 8 ft.
    high. This wall is rounded at its northern extremity, and forms the
    divisional wall between the passage and the eastern enclosure. Neither
    the eastern nor the western enclosures can at present be defined on
    their northern sides, though lines of block débris would appear to fix
    their boundaries.</p>

  <p>The most interesting architectural feature in the “Outspan Ruins” is
    the conical tower built to form part of the main wall. This is an
    independent structure from its base upwards. It is 9 ft. high, and
    though built of irregularly shaped stones and without much adherence to
    courses, it is symmetrical in appearance. On its west side between it
    and the rounded end of the main wall is a space 2 in. wide on the floor
    and 5 ft. wide at 6 ft. from the floor. This narrow loopholed space
    still remains open, save for a single slab which at 6 ft. above the
    floor is built into the tower and the main wall, thus forming a sort of
    stone shelf. On the eastern side of the tower the space between it and
    the rounded wall of the entrance is neatly built up, and a slab is laid
    from the rounded wall into the courses of the tower at 5 ft. above the
    floor. Possibly these slabs on either side of the tower formed raised
    platforms to afford a view over the wall, while the narrow loophole
    might have served as a look-out. The circumference of the tower at 5
    ft. from its base is 19 ft. 3 in.</p>

  <p>The portion of these ruins which lies to the south of the main wall
    comprises (1) a wall running south at right angles to the main wall at
    4 ft. from the west side of the entrance. This wall is 24 ft. long,
    and averages 3 ft. 6 in. in height, and is 2 ft. wide on its present
    summit; (2) a circular buttress built independently and standing
    opposite the outside of the main entrance at a distance of 8 ft. 6 in.
    Its height is now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span> only 3 ft. 10 in., and its circumference at base
    is 28 ft. 4 in. It is hollow in the centre, and it has collapsed from
    summit to base on its southern side for a width of 3 ft. The obvious
    object of this buttress is to divide the open space on the outside of
    the entrance into two narrow passages, each of which could easily be
    defended by a few even against a great number of besiegers.</p>

  <p>At 36 ft. east of the south side of the entrance is an outcrop of a
    wall 6 ft. long, and this runs due south at some 5 ft. in front of the
    main wall.</p>

      <span class="small">“THE VALLEY OF RUINS”</span>
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="subheadc">Posselt, Philips, Maund, Renders, Mauch Ruins, and South-East Ruins.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">“THE Valley of Ruins” is on the north-east and east sides of the
    Elliptical Temple, and almost half-way between it and the south side
    of the east end of the Acropolis Hill. This conglomeration of ruins
    extends from the edge of the slope which runs along the north-east
    sides of both Elliptical Temple and No. 1 Ruins to within 60 yds. of
    the west side of East Ruins, and covers an area of about 250 yds. from
    east to west and 120 yds. from north to south. This area is the upper
    portion of the Zimbabwe Valley, which descends towards the east, the
    streams from this valley during the rainy season falling into the
    Mapudzi stream, which runs southwards down the Schlichter Gorge towards
    the Moshawasha Valley, and later finds its way into the Motelekwe River.</p>

  <p>Till 1902–3 these extensive ruins, some of which are massive and most
    excellently constructed, remained not only unexplored but unexamined,
    and no particulars or plan had ever been attempted to be given, all
    writers being content to refer to them as “The Valley of Ruins,” while
    some writers altogether ignore the existence of the group. Dr. Helm, of
    Morgenster, whose professional duties have taken him twice every month
    for the last six years within a few score yards of the ruins, states
    that he never supposed the wood and the jungle contained any walls.</p>

  <p>Since the Occupation in 1890 no attention has been paid to these
    ruins. No visitors’ or even native paths crossed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span> area, nor are
    there the slightest traces in the shape of trenches of relic hunters
    and gold prospectors having worked here. So unfrequented has it been
    that some fair-sized buck have recently been shot within the walls.
    The area was found to be covered with an almost impenetrable jungle of
    trees, bushes, and creepers. The local natives declared the place to be
    bewitched, and consequently they avoided it.</p>

  <p>“The Valley of Ruins” has recently (1903) been found to consist of
    three groups, each of which includes several distinct ruins, some being
    of an important character.</p>

  <p>The area is divided as follows:—</p>

  <p>1. Lower or north-eastern section, including the Posselt, Philips, and
    Maund Ruins.</p>

  <p>2. Middle section, which lies between the lower section and the edge of
    the slope of land on the north-east side of the Elliptical Temple.</p>

  <p>3. Upper section, including all ruins between the Elliptical Temple
    and the edge of the slope overlooking lower portions of “The Valley of
    Ruins.”</p>

  <p>Before describing these complicated groups there are some features
    represented by them which may be mentioned.</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) Several of these ruins, especially those in the lower section,
    are exceedingly massive and well built, the courses marvellously
    true with an absence of straight joints. The curves of the wall are
    beautifully designed and are laid on boldly sweeping lines. The
    material is good, and is also most carefully selected and sized. The
    masonry of many of the walls is far superior to that of some of the
    divisional walls of the Elliptical Temple and to the majority of the
    walls on the Acropolis.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) The absence of the angular style of buildings, except with
    certain structures in the middle section. Rounded entrances and
    buttresses and gracefully rounded ends of walls form the most
    prevailing features of most of these ruins. Two conical towers, several
    very large semi-circular buttresses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span> or platforms form prominent
    features. Two drains were discovered (1903) in Philips Ruins and three
    in Posselt Ruins (B).</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) The middle section is poorly built, and possesses some angular
    features. The upper section is well built.</p>

  <p>(<i>d</i>) The discovery (1903) in the lower section of these ruins of gold
    articles, decorated and plain soapstone beams and relics of the oldest
    type, including the soapstone beam with bird on summit—the finest
    specimen yet found in Zimbabwe—point to the fact that certain of these
    ruins were used for somewhat higher purposes than those of forts or
    workshops, possibly, as many now suggest, as residences for priests
    or officials connected with the temple. This surmise is justifiable,
    seeing that the north-east passage connects such well-built and
    substantial portions of these mines directly with the North Entrance
    and Parallel Passage and Sacred Enclosure of the Elliptical Temple.
    In the lower section of these ruins there are no traces of ancient or
    native industries having been carried on.</p>

  <p>(<i>e</i>) In the lower section of these ruins there are fewer signs of
    modern or even of very old Makalanga clay huts, such as are fully
    described in “<em>Native huts found in ruins</em>.” No modern articles were
    found here. The consequence is there has been in this lower group of
    ruins very little artificial filling-up of the enclosures, and the
    ruins are more open and are easier of examination than most of the
    other ruins at Zimbabwe. But being on lower ground, with a huge bank
    of granite and soil on the south-western flank, there has been a
    considerable amount of soil silted into the ruins during the course of
    hundreds of years, but not to any great depth. The filling-in, both
    natural, is no more than about 2 ft., as compared with 5 ft. and 7
    ft. in other ruins elsewhere where there are abundant signs of native
    occupation.</p>

  <div class="center">LOWER SECTION OF THE “VALLEY OF RUINS”</div>

  <h3>POSSELT RUINS</h3>

  <p>These ruins are the most westerly of the lower section of <em>The Valley
    of Ruins</em>. They consist of two almost oval-shaped buildings adjoining
    each other, and for the purposes of this description are marked <i>A</i> and
    <i>B</i> respectively on the plan. This set of ruins lies at the north-east
    extremity of the <em>North-East Passage</em> leading from the <em>Elliptical
    Temple</em>.</p>

  <p><i>A</i> is 175 ft. long from north to south, and 91 ft. from east to west.
    <i>B</i> lies at almost right angles to <i>A</i> on its south-west side, and is
    110 ft. from east to west, and 75 ft. from north to south.</p>

  <p>The interesting points concerning the Posselt Ruins are:—</p>

  <p>(1) The discovery of beaten gold and of the older class of relics.</p>

  <p>(2) Two entrances with unworked soapstone beams used as lintels in
    portcullis grooves.</p>

  <p>(3) Complicated entrances; a small conical tower; cement dadoes; a
    parallel passage; circular and semi-circular buttresses; only slight
    artificial filling-in of interior; some evidence of occupation by old
    or modern natives.</p>

  <p>(4) Massive character of walls originally averaging at least 15 ft.
    in height; excellent construction, main walls being superior to many
    divisional walls in the <em>Elliptical Temple</em> and to most of the walls on
    the <em>Acropolis</em>; the overwhelming predominance of the rounded style of
    architecture.</p>

  <p>(5) No evidence of either ancient or native industries having been
    carried on in these ruins.</p>

  <h3>SECTION A OF POSSELT RUINS</h3>

  <p><i>Main walls.</i>—The main walls average from 7 ft. to 12 ft. in height
    above the surface of the veld, while the height of the interior
    faces, which are some 3 ft. above the outside level, averages 6 ft.
    to 9 ft. The great amount of wall débris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span> at the foot of the walls
    suggests an original average height of at least 15 ft. above the cement
    floors. Some practical builders have computed it to have been almost
    20 ft., and the batter-back would permit of this. The average of 15
    ft. is a very conservative estimate of the original height. There is
    more dilapidation on the outside top edges of the walls than on the
    inside. The width of the main walls at base averages 6 ft., and on
    the reduced summit at 9 ft. above the outer surface of the ground
    4 ft. Some of the divisional walls are almost equally as massive.
    As is usual in the rounded style of building, the main walls, also
    the foundations, widen out as they near an entrance. The curves of
    the walls are most symmetrical, especially of the wall which curves
    outwards from the north to the east-south-east. Two granite beams—one 6
    ft. 3 in. high—once stood erect on the north-east portion of the main
    wall. A flat granite slab still stands erect on the west wall. Other
    long granite beams were found at the foot of the wall both outside
    and inside. The foundations of the main walls are carried under the
    entrances and form their floors.</p>

    <div class="caption">Sketch Plan<br />POSSELT RUINS<br />“Valley of Ruins”<br />(<em>Lower Section</em>) </div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span></p>

  <p><i>Construction.</i>—The construction of the main walls and also of some of
    the divisional walls is good, though there are places where a rather
    inferior workmanship can be noticed. On the whole, the courses are
    regular, straight joints are infrequent, and the sizes of the blocks of
    each course show they were carefully selected. There are a few short
    lengths of walls in the interior which do not appear to have been parts
    of the original building. These are erected upon the black vegetable
    mould, and are poorly constructed, are slight and of indifferent
    material, being almost identical, if not quite so, with old Makalanga
    walls, the noticeable feature of which is the building of one stone
    exactly above and squarely on the block below without any pretence at
    bonding. This is known as the column style, and can be seen in walls
    in native villages as well as within certain ruins at Zimbabwe, mainly
    on the <em>Acropolis</em>, where, as in these ruins, there are the remains of
    very old Makalanga cement huts.</p>

  <p><i>Entrances.</i>—There are four rounded entrances through the main wall;
    possibly there was a fifth on the east side where there is a wide gap.
    There are twelve entrances in divisional walls, nine of which are
    rounded, two being partly angular and partly rounded, and one angular,
    this last being before referred to as probably of later construction.
    It is almost certain that many more divisional entrances will yet be
    discovered, as several of the divisional walls only just outcrop above
    the surface of the interior. Almost every entrance has portcullis
    grooves. All four of the entrances through the main wall have rounded
    buttresses on either side projecting into the interior of the building.
    Three of the more important divisional entrances also have rounded
    buttresses on each side of the entrance.</p>

  <p>The E.N.E. entrance was evidently the main entrance. Its walls are very
    massive, and the arrangement of the inner walls strongly suggests the
    intention to protect the entrance and afford a second line of defence.
    This entrance generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span> is the most imposing of all four approaches.
    It opens directly on to the exterior of the building, which the west
    entrance does not; nor most probably did the S.E. entrance, which
    opens out towards other ruins. The E.N.E. entrance varies in width
    from 2 ft. 10 in. to 4 ft., and the passage is 12 ft. long. The side
    walls are 5 ft. high, but rise sharply towards the exterior to 8 ft.
    and 11 ft. respectively, and both are about 6 ft. wide on floor level.
    As in the entrances through the main wall of the <em>Elliptical Temple</em>,
    the foundations run under the entrance and form its passage floor.
    The entrance has two buttresses on the inner side, and these have
    portcullis grooves.</p>

  <p>The west entrance opens in <em>Section B</em> of the <em>Posselt Ruins</em>. This is
    1 ft. 10 in. wide, 7 ft. long, and the side walls are 7 ft. high above
    the floor and 6 ft. wide on the floor level. The entrance shows remains
    of portcullis grooves. The floor of the entrance is 2 ft. above the
    cement floor of the interior of the building, and there are the remains
    of large rounded cement steps down on to the floor. On the inner side
    is the <em>Parallel Passage</em>, described later, and as in this passage
    are a quantity of buttresses, these show that the entrance was well
    protected from attack from the side of <em>Section B</em>, especially on the
    north outer side of the entrance, where is what visitors have called a
    “sentry-box,” a small walled-in area immediately adjoining and opening
    directly upon the entrance into <em>Section A</em>. The elaborate protection
    of this entrance from attacks from <em>Section B</em> would appear to show
    that <em>Section A</em> was regarded by the builders as the more important
    portion of these buildings.</p>

  <p>The south-east entrance opens out on to the veld, but there are
    extensive ruins, portion of the middle section of “The Valley of
    Ruins,” at a few yards’ distance in front of it with traces of walls
    between. This entrance is 2 ft. 4 in. wide between the buttresses, and
    3 ft. wide between the sides of the main wall. It is 11 ft. long, and
    the side walls are 7 ft.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span> high on either side, rising rapidly on the
    east side to 10 ft. There is a pair of rounded buttresses 5 ft. high on
    the inner side, and these have portcullis grooves. It is probable that
    this was the entrance used by the ancient occupiers on ascending from
    these ruins to the <em>Elliptical Temple</em>, as the north-eastern extremity
    of the <em>North-East Passage</em> is not many yards away from this entrance.</p>

  <p>An entrance through a divisional wall just within and on the west side
    of the E.N.E. entrance is worthy of notice. This passes through a
    wall 6 ft. wide on floor level, and 7 ft. high on the south-west side
    and 6 ft. high on the north-east side. In this entrance, which has
    rounded buttresses on the inner side, a length of unworked soapstone
    beam was found acting as a side lintel in a portcullis groove, also
    the fragments of a corresponding soapstone lintel. In this entrance
    was discovered (March, 1903) beaten gold and fragments of decorated
    soapstone bowls.</p>

  <p><em>Parallel Passage.</em>—This is the sixth parallel passage so far
    discovered at Zimbabwe, and is about the fifth in importance. It runs
    for 66 ft. on the inside of, and parallel to, the west main wall. The
    inner or east wall of the passage is formed by a line of buttresses
    with short walls between each, and in these walls are various entrances
    leading towards the interior of the building. No portion of this inner
    wall is more than 5 ft. in height, though the wall débris along their
    summits rises 2 ft. higher. The passage is defended by several pairs of
    rounded buttresses with portcullis grooves, and averages in width from
    5 ft. to 8 ft.</p>

  <p>The passage commences on the south side of the west entrance which
    leads from <em>Section B</em> of these ruins. Two large rounded buttresses
    form its southern extremity. The buttress on the west side, which is
    5 ft. high, projects 5 ft. into the walled-in area opposite to the
    inside of the west entrance, and the eastern buttress, which is 4 ft.
    high, projects 3 ft. to meet it, leaving the entrance between them 3
    ft. wide. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span> are no portcullis grooves, but it is probable, judging
    by the position of the débris, that a pair of rounded buttresses once
    stood on either side of the entrance. Portcullis grooves are most
    usually found in such additional buttresses. In this walled-in area,
    facing the inside of the west entrance, is a passage-way leading into
    the interior of the building, but this still remains unexplored.</p>

  <p>Going north from this point, the Parallel Passage is narrowed to 4
    ft. by a rounded buttress 5 ft. high projecting from the inner or
    eastern side of the passage. From this buttress a wall 5 ft. high runs
    north-east and parallel to the inside of main wall for 13 ft., the
    passage along this length being about 4 ft. 6 in. wide. At the northern
    end of this length of wall are a pair of rounded buttresses 4 ft. 6 in.
    high with portcullis grooves. The entrance between the two is 1 ft.
    10 in. wide, and these are built upon the same foundation which forms
    the floor of the entrance. At 16 ft. further north is another pair
    projecting from either side into the passage. The one on the west side
    is 5 ft. high, is rounded, and has a portcullis groove. The opposite
    is 3 ft. high and greatly dilapidated. It is angular on one side and
    rounded on the other, and there are traces only of a portcullis groove.
    The quality of the construction differs, the rounded buttress being the
    better built. Possibly the other buttress is a reconstruction of a much
    later date. The entrance between the buttresses is 2 ft. 6 in. wide.
    Both buttresses are erected on the same foundation which forms the
    floor of the entrance.</p>

  <p>Between the last-described two pairs of buttresses and on the east side
    is a roughly built entrance 1 ft. 10 in. wide, with the two buttresses
    angular on the outside and rounded on the inside. This leads into
    the interior of the building. At the northern end of the passage and
    on the east side and leading into the interior is an entrance with
    portcullis grooves built upon a curved line. The west corners, which
    are 3 ft. 6 in.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span> high, are angular, but the inside walls are rounded.
    This is altogether better built and more substantial than the entrance
    previously described. The northern extremity of the passage is abrupt
    on its eastern side, which faces the south end of the gap in the main
    west wall, and the presumption is that the passage was originally
    continued further north, but that when the main wall fell the eastern
    side of the passage was also destroyed.</p>

  <p>In places the floor of the passage shows by the wall of a large
    semi-circular buttress which projects 11 ft. from the inner face of
    the main wall. All the walls surrounding the area are very well built.
    The south side is formed by an opening 2 ft. 4 in. wide between the
    semi-circular buttress and the west side of the conical tower, by the
    conical tower, by an opening 2 ft. wide between the east side of the
    tower and a rounded buttress 4 ft. high, which projects 3 ft. 6 in.
    from the wall forming the east side of the enclosure. The floor, which
    is made of granite cement, is 1 ft. above the floor on the south, and
    is approached by a rounded step.</p>

  <p><em>Conical Tower.</em>—This tower and the Conical Tower in the adjoining
    <em>Philips Ruins</em> are almost identical in construction and position. It
    has a circumference at 14 in. above its foundation of 17 ft. 6 in., and
    at 3 ft. 6 in. above this level the circumference is 15 ft. 6 in. It
    is impossible to measure its circumference at base owing to the cement
    floor enclosing its north and north-east sides. It is 5 ft. 8 in. high
    from base on the north side and 4 ft. on the south side. The filling-in
    process of very late occupiers has caused its dilapidation. The tower
    has been proved to be solid.</p>

  <p><i>Semi-circular Buttress.</i>—A large remains of pavement, portions being
    cemented and portions paved with blocks. A large rounded granite cement
    step crosses the northern end of the passage.</p>

  <p><i>Dadoes.</i>—In the passage and on the lower inside face of the main wall
    are several lengths of granite cement dadoes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span> the longest being 10 ft.
    and 12 ft. The dadoes are still 2 ft. to 3 ft. high, and about 3 in. to
    5 in. thick.</p>

  <p><i>Enclosures.</i>—It is probable, judging by the number of sections of
    divisional walls outcropping above the surface of the interior, that
    there are some eight or ten distinct enclosures within <em>Section
    A</em> of these ruins. Some enclosures have several entrances, all so
    far discovered being rounded. The divisional walls of most of the
    enclosures are massive and well built, some being far superior in
    construction and material to several of the divisional walls in the
    <em>Elliptical Temple</em>.</p>

  <p>The most perfect enclosure is on the inner side of the north-east,
    immediately west of the E.N.E entrance. This was entirely filled in
    with soil and blocks up to the tops of the walls, which are 7 ft. and 8
    ft. high. All this filling-in has now been removed (March, 1903), and
    a conical tower, which had been completely buried, was discovered. The
    area is formed on the north-east side by the inner face of the main
    wall, which is 7 ft. high and 11 ft. long, on the east side by a wall
    7 ft. high and 9 ft. long, and on the west side it averages from 2 in.
    to 4 in. in thickness. Its faces are usually smoothed and the tops are
    rounded off inwards.</p>

  <p><i>Native huts.</i>—There are the remains of seven old native huts in this
    section of the ruins. These are identical with No. 3 huts described in
    “<cite>Makalanga huts within ancient ruins</cite>,” see “<cite>Notes on Architecture</cite>.”
    They are built about 2 ft. and 3 ft. above the ancient cement floors.
    Two are built across gaps in divisional walls, and one partially covers
    a portion of the gap in the north-west main wall, which, had it been
    intact, would not have enabled the builders of the hut to find room for
    the erection of their dwelling.</p>

  <h3>POSSELT RUINS. SECTION B</h3>

  <p>This lies to the west of <em>Section A</em> of the <em>Posselt Ruins</em>, which it
    immediately adjoins on its south-west side and practically forms part
    of the same ruins.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span></p>

  <p>Its area is 110 ft. from east to west, and 75 ft. from north to south,
    and is oval in plan. The construction of the walls is excellent, and
    this section appears to be one of the earliest period ruins. Its
    central portion has been filled in, and some of the walls dividing off
    the enclosures are still buried beneath the débris. There are no signs
    of native occupation of the interior of the ruins, but on the outside
    of the building are the circular ruins of old native huts and débris
    consisting mostly of ashes, bones, and pottery.</p>

  <p>Only the three enclosures at the west end have been cleared out to
    their old floors, but nothing was found of any antique character.</p>

  <p><i>Walls.</i>—The outer walls are massive and show excellent construction,
    and average in height between 5 ft. and 10 ft., their width being 6 ft.
    at 5 ft. above the ground. The inner walls are also massive and are
    fairly well built, being 5 ft. wide at 4 ft. above the ground. There is
    a narrow and low divisional wall of poor construction cutting off the
    north-east portion of these ruins, and this most probably is of later
    date.</p>

  <p><i>Entrances.</i>—There are only two entrances through the main or outer
    walls. The one on the north-east side is 2 ft. 6 in. wide, and has
    very massive walls, which are rounded, and all exceptionally well
    constructed. There is a pair of rounded buttresses immediately inside,
    and these have portcullis grooves. The foundation of the main wall
    forms the floor of the entrance passage.</p>

  <p>The south entrance is 4 ft. wide, and is built upon the foundation of
    the main south wall. It is narrowed to 2 ft. by two rounded buttresses,
    and these have portcullis grooves.</p>

  <p>“<i>Sentry-box.</i>”—This class of structure has been popularly termed
    “sentry-box.” In the angle at the north-east corner is a rounded wall
    with a narrow opening into the inside. This is situated close to the
    entrance leading into <em>Section A</em>, and its position suggests the idea
    that it was used as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span> sentry-box guarding the entrance. There are
    several of these structures at Zimbabwe, and they all occupy a similar
    position near entrances.</p>

  <p><i>Drains.</i>—There are three drains through the walls of this section of
    the <em>Posselt Ruins</em>, one in the south wall passing through a wall 5 ft.
    6 in. wide, one in a divisional wall, 4 ft. wide, which projects from
    the south main wall towards the north, and one in a divisional wall 5
    ft. wide at the north-west of the building.</p>

  <p>A semi-circular buttress projects 11 ft. into the interior from the
    cunei face of the north-east main wall. It is 27 ft. round its outer
    face. On the east side the buttress is 8 ft. high, and on the south and
    west sides, owing to dilapidations, and also to a higher floor, these
    faces are only 4 ft. and 5 ft. high. The top surface is covered with a
    foot depth of granite cement.</p>

  <p><i>Circular platform.</i>—This is at the eastern extremity of the ruins.
    It is 21 ft. in diameter and 5 ft. above the floors of the adjoining
    enclosures. On the east side the summit is approached by granite cement
    steps which are large and well rounded, and on the south by stone steps.</p>

  <p>On the west of this platform are two raised enclosures immediately
    on the inside of the main wall. The northern one has steps leading
    some way towards the west side of the <em>Circular Platform</em>, and there
    probably once reached its summit.</p>

  <p><i>Cement dadoes.</i>—In these ruins are many lengths of granite cement
    dado work, the greatest length intact being 33 ft., and this is on the
    east of the west main wall. This work is also extensively found in
    the <em>Parallel Passage</em>. Not only is it found on the faces of walls,
    but also on round buttresses and on the side walls of entrances, thus
    reducing their widths by about 5 in. It runs about 3 ft. higher than
    the cemented floors.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span></p>

  <h3>PHILIPS RUINS</h3>

  <p>These ruins lie to the east of the <em>Posselt Ruins</em>, which they almost
    adjoin, being only 8 yds. apart at their nearest points. These ruins
    present several most interesting features:—</p>

  <p>(1) The discovery (March, 1903) of the finest, most perfect, and most
    elaborately decorated soapstone beam with bird on summit yet found at
    <em>Great Zimbabwe</em>, also of phalli and beaten gold.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_376">
    <img src="images/i_376.jpg" width="600" height="447" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Sketch Plan<br />PHILIPS’ RUINS<br />“Valley of Ruins”<br />(<i>Lower
      Section</i>)</div>
  </div>

  <p>(2) An excellently constructed and massive wall, built upon the plan
    of a section of a circle, with its centre facing due east, and the
    discovery of quantities of sections of worked soapstone beams along
    its base, together with fragments of carved soapstone bowls, and also
    ancient relics of the oldest type.</p>

  <p>(3) A small conical tower uncovered March, 1903.</p>

  <p>(4) Excellent and massive character of the construction of the walls of
    the numerous rounded entrances, buttresses, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span> ends of walls. There
    are two drains, also a tall slate beam built into a portcullis groove
    to form a side lintel post in an entrance.</p>

  <p>(5) The complete absence of signs of native occupation of these ruins
    except on the east side of the large curved wall, and these are slight.</p>

  <p><i>Area.</i>—The area occupied by these ruins is 140 ft. from east to west,
    and 150 ft. from north to south. There is no main outer wall on the
    south side, and it is probable, judging by wall débris, that these
    ruins extended some 20 yds. further south.</p>

  <p><i>Main walls.</i>—These extend from the west side round the north to the
    south-east, the rest having disappeared; or possibly Posselt Ruins and
    these were originally one immense ruin, so that an outer wall on the
    west side might never have existed; but this could not have been the
    case with regard to the south side.</p>

  <p>The main outer walls average from 5 ft. to 9 ft. in height on their
    outer faces, and 3 ft. to 8 ft. on their inner sides, the interior of
    the building being on a considerably higher level than the exterior.
    This is owing mainly to the natural fall of the ground towards the
    north-east and east on which the ruins are built. The widths of the
    main walls vary from 6 ft. to 8 ft. on floor level, 5 ft. at 6 ft.
    above the floor, while some reduced summits have a width of 5 ft. at 9
    ft. above the floor.</p>

  <p><i>Construction.</i>—These ruins, especially some portions, such as the
    massive curved wall, are most excellently built. The selection of
    the blocks, the good and even quality of the granite employed, show
    that some special importance was attached to these portions of the
    ruins. Except for one small buttress, the angular style of building is
    absolutely absent from these structures.</p>

  <p>The divisional walls are also well built, and are superior to the main
    and outer walls of several ruins at Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span></p>

  <p><i>Curved wall.</i>—This wall forms the most prominent feature in these
    ruins, and it at once attracts the attention of all visitors on account
    of its symmetrical and massive character, excellent workmanship, and
    the height of its reduced summit, which has the extraordinary width of
    5 ft. at 13 ft. from the ground. The curve is laid on so exact a plan
    that it was an easy matter for a surveyor to definitely determine the
    centre of the arc. The centre of the curve faces outwards due east,
    and standing at the centre of the arc the extremities of the wall
    are found to be E.N.E. and E.S.E. respectively. It is 125 ft. round
    its inner face at 6 ft. above the remains of cement flooring, and 84
    ft. round its outer face at the same height from the ground, but its
    outer extremities are hidden behind rounded walls and buttresses. The
    distance between the two extremities across the bow is 75 ft., and
    from that line to the centre of the curve the distance is 23 ft. The
    batter-back of the wall is 1 ft. 3 in. in 10 ft.</p>

  <p>The height of the reduced summit for 60 ft. averages 9 ft. to 13 ft.
    on either side of the wall, but as these heights are taken from raised
    cement steps, platforms, and sections of floors, at least another 2 ft.
    or 3 ft. may be added to their present reduced height, for the greatest
    height from foundation to summit is 15 ft. 6 in. The original height
    may safely be estimated at 20 ft. above the cement flooring. This
    estimate is justified by the great amount of wall débris found along
    the bases of either side of the wall. On the summit near the south end
    of the wall are the remains of a banquette, and these inner terraces or
    look-outs are almost invariably behind walls which are at least breast
    high above the floor of the banquette; moreover, the batter-back of
    the faces of the wall would well allow of a wall 20 ft. high and yet
    leave a fairly wide summit. Where the entrance facing the E.N.E. passes
    through this wall, the side walls are reduced to 5 ft. in height on
    either side above the floor of the entrance, which is 3 ft. above the
    foundation of the wall.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span></p>

  <p>This entrance, like those in the main walls of the <em>Elliptical Temple</em>,
    is carried over the foundation of the wall, and this forms its passage
    floor. It is 2 ft. wide and 6 ft. 6 in. long, and has two rounded
    buttresses on the inner side, and these have portcullis grooves. These
    buttresses are built upon a semi-circular platform projecting 6 ft.
    into the interior of the building, thus making the entrance passage
    about 12 ft. in length. The floor of the entrance is covered with
    granite cement.</p>

  <p>One peculiar feature in the construction of this wall is that, while
    the northern end is rounded off, the southern end is continued in the
    form of a portion of a loop, which circles southwards and eastwards,
    and then runs back into the east face of the curved wall, enclosing
    an almost circular area of 10 ft. in diameter. The wall in this loop
    is well built. The average height of the loop-wall is 6 ft., but on
    the south side it rises to 10 ft., where the width of the summit is 3
    ft. The interior was rudely filled up with stones, below which was a
    cement floor 3 ft. higher than the outside level and 6 ft. above the
    foundation. This raised platform or pulpit is approached on the west
    side by a few steps leading up to a rounded opening into the loop.</p>

  <p>This curved wall, massive as it is, does not form an outer wall of
    these ruins, but crosses their centre, dividing them into two parts.
    It is apparently independent so far as its plan, superior character of
    construction, and purpose are concerned.</p>

  <p>At the west side of the curved wall, and at the centre of the curve,
    is a wall 23 ft. long projecting towards the interior of the building.
    This is 3 ft. high at its western extremity, but its summit rapidly
    rises to 8 ft. in height. It has a slight curve towards the south. On
    its north side is a small recess extending from base to summit, and
    this is exactly similar in construction to the recesses in “<em>Buttress</em>”
    or “<em>Recess Enclosure</em>” on the <em>Acropolis</em>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span></p>

  <p>On either side of this wall, and in the angles formed by the curved
    wall, are low granite cement platforms which are rounded on the front
    faces. These resemble the “<em>blind steps</em>” found in all the main ruins
    at Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the erection of the curved wall might possibly have
    been for solar or astronomical observations, and though this is a mere
    conjecture, the following points may lend it some support:—</p>

  <p>(1) In close proximity to this curved wall, and on its eastern side,
    was discovered the soapstone beam with carved bird on the summit—this
    being the finest specimen yet discovered at Zimbabwe—also phalli and
    ancient relics of the oldest type. The soapstone birds had so far been
    discovered only at the <em>Western and Eastern Temples</em> on the <em>Acropolis</em>.</p>

  <p>(2) The discovery under the wall débris which lay along each side of
    the wall at its base of quantities of lengths of broken soapstone beams
    which, though not carved, had been worked with tools, the widths of the
    edges of the chisel being very plainly discernible, some sections being
    beautifully rounded and polished. These are believed to have originally
    decorated the summit of the wall, a suggestion supported by the shape
    and markings on the bases of several beams so discovered. Soapstone
    beams once fixed on the summits of walls had previously been discovered
    only at the three temples.</p>

  <p>(3) The proximity of a small conical tower in an adjoining enclosure at
    the north-eastern end of this wall.</p>

  <p>(4) The large raised platform formed by the looped wall, and originally
    approached by steps on the west side, somewhat corresponds in position
    with the <em>Platform</em> in the <em>Elliptical Temple</em> and at the <em>Western
    Temple</em>, and with the <em>Balcony</em> at the <em>Eastern Temple</em>.</p>

  <p><i>Conical Tower.</i>—This is situated in the most north-easterly enclosure
    of these ruins. It is still 6 ft. 6 in. in height, but judging from the
    block débris it was once much higher. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span> 3 ft. 6 in. above the granite
    cement floor at its base it has a circumference of 18 ft. 10 in. It is
    impossible to measure the circumference of its base, as a large rounded
    cement step extends between it and the south wall of the enclosure. The
    tower, which has a fair and noticeable batter-back, is very well built.
    It has been proved to be solid. Its foundations are 6 in. below the
    cement floor. There are four of these small conical towers at Zimbabwe,
    two having been discovered in March, 1903. On the east side of this
    tower, and built up against its east side, is a small rounded platform
    3 ft. high, covered with granite cement, which is approached by two
    large steps.</p>

  <p><i>Entrances.</i>—There are three entrances to these ruins—the north,
    north-east, and east—and most probably others will be found as further
    exploration work is carried on here.</p>

  <p>The north entrance appears to have been the main approach. This
    is an intricate entrance, and one which appears to have possessed
    considerable importance in the minds of the original builders. It lies
    between two outer rounded walls, each 6 ft. high, which curve inwards
    towards each other so as to form a passage-way about 6 ft. wide, which
    is again narrowed at its southern extremity to 2 ft. 6 in. by two
    rounded buttresses on either side. These buttresses have portcullis
    grooves. The area opens into a small walled-in area, 10 ft. by 10 ft.,
    the walls being 6 ft. high, and very well and substantially built.
    The floor is made of granite cement. There are three rounded walls in
    this area. A buttress with a portcullis groove is in the south-western
    corner of the area, but the corresponding buttress has disappeared. The
    walled-in area would have enabled twenty defenders to protect the 2 ft.
    6 in. wide entrance from being forced by an attacking party. The west
    side of the entrance passage is carried further south by two walls,
    each built upon a semi-circular plan.</p>

  <p>The north-east entrance opens into the enclosure which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span> contains the
    Conical Tower already described. The side walls are 5 ft. high, and 4
    ft. and 5 ft. wide at this height from the floor. The entrance is 2 ft.
    4 in. wide, and including the steps it is 9 ft. long. A semi-circular
    platform projects 6 ft. into the enclosure, and on it are built two
    rounded buttresses with portcullis grooves. These buttresses are in an
    advanced state of dilapidation. There are three steps between these
    buttresses, and these lead down on to the floor of the interior.
    An immense slate beam rises out of the ground immediately on the
    north-east side of the exterior of the entrance.</p>

  <p>At present only the south side of the east entrance has been opened
    out. This is 4 ft. high, and is rounded. On the inner side is a
    semi-circular buttress hollow inside with an opening into it from the
    south side.</p>

  <p>All the entrances, of which there are seven in the divisional walls,
    are rounded, and most have portcullis grooves.</p>

  <p>At the centre of the eastern face of the curved wall is a rounded
    entrance with portcullis groove, in which is built a slate beam which
    stands 8 ft. above the floor. The total length of the beam is at least
    11 ft. This is the most perfect specimen of all the stone lintels built
    in portcullis grooves.</p>

  <p><i>Enclosures.</i>—Judging from sections of divisional walls, there were in
    all probability no less than sixteen enclosures in these ruins. Some
    were of large area, but subdivided. All the divisional walls are laid
    on curved lines. The only complete enclosure is the one on the north
    side, where is the Conical Tower. The wall on the south side is from 5
    ft. to 9 ft. high, on the west side 5 ft. to 10 ft., and on the north
    side, which is the main outer wall of the ruins, 5 ft. This latter
    wall, which is curved outwards towards the north-east, is 4 ft. wide at
    5 ft. above the ground. A cement floor is laid around the tower. The
    west entrance was described earlier under the heading of “<em>Entrances</em>.”</p>

  <p><i>Buttresses.</i>—In these ruins are numerous rounded buttresses. A large
    semi-circular buttress 4 ft. to 5 ft. high, 22 ft. round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span> the face,
    9 ft. from back to front, and 12 ft. across the back, faces the east
    and outer side of the centre of the curved wall, from which point the
    buttress is due east at 25 ft. distance. On the west side of this
    buttress is a passage with cement floor, rounded steps, and dadoes.</p>

  <p><i>Drains.</i>—So far as these ruins have been cleared, only two drains have
    been exposed, one through a wall 5 ft. wide, which wall runs parallel
    to the east side of the large curved wall, and one through the main
    wall leading from the north-east enclosure.</p>

  <p><i>Cement.</i>—Granite cement has been extensively employed at these ruins,
    both for flooring, dadoes, and steps, also for platforms in the angles
    of walls, which somewhat resemble the “blind steps” in the angles of
    the divisional walls of the <em>Elliptical Temple</em>.</p>

  <h3>MAUND RUINS</h3>

  <p>These ruins, though not extensive, appear to have been of some
    importance. They are situated at a distance of 60 yds. from the
    east-north-east side of Philips Ruins, and lie almost half-way between
    those ruins and the East Ruins.</p>

  <p>Their construction is excellent, and the walls are massive, while all
    the entrances are rounded, most having possessed a pair of granite
    lintel beams. Although built upon by far the lowest level of any
    ruin at Zimbabwe, it is the least filled-in, either naturally or
    artificially, by any native occupiers. There are very few traces of
    Makalanga occupation. The granite cement floors are at a depth of 1 ft.
    to 2 ft. below the surface soil within the interior. No ancient relics,
    save fragments of soapstone bowls carved with chevron pattern, have
    been found here.</p>

  <p>The most interesting points as to these ruins are:—</p>

  <p>(1) Two very fine rounded ends of walls, both being excellent pieces of
    masonry.</p>

  <p>(2) Two structures facing east and west respectively, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span> summits
    being approached by large steps, and each associated with one of the
    rounded walls.</p>

  <p>(3) Sections of red clay walls in the gaps of the stone walls.</p>

  <p>The area of these ruins is 143 ft. from east to west, and 138 ft. from
    north to south. There is some evidence that these ruins once occupied a
    larger area.</p>

    <div class="caption">Sketch Plan<br />MAUND RUINS<br />“Valley of Ruins”<br />(<em>Lower Section</em>)</div>
  </div>

  <p>There is only one entrance, so far discovered, through the main wall,
    and this faces north. It is massive and well built, and opens into a
    vestibule enclosure 15 ft. long, 9 ft. wide, and 5 ft. and 7 ft. in
    height. The side walls of the entrance are 5 ft. high, the width of the
    main wall is 6 ft. 6 in., the width of the passage 3 ft., but narrowed
    on the inside to less than 2 ft. by two rounded buttresses with
    portcullis grooves, the south one of which has almost disappeared.</p>

  <p>The east end of the south wall of the vestibule enclosure is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>one of
    two beautifully rounded ends of walls before referred to. The symmetry
    of the batter-back is perfect. This wall is 7 ft. high, 5 ft. wide at
    base, and 3 ft. 10 in. at summit. The vestibule has a granite cement
    floor. At the east end of the vestibule is one large rounded buttress
    with portcullis grooves. The corresponding buttress on the south-west
    side is much ruined.</p>

    <div class="caption">NORTH-EAST WALL, MAUND RUINS, VALLEY OF RUINS</div>
  </div>

  <p>On the west side of the ruins, and immediately west of the west wall
    of the vestibule wall, and built from wall to wall in the angle of the
    main and vestibule wall, is a raised platform 6 ft. high approached
    by four rows of stone steps once covered with granite cement. This
    structure is apparently different in purpose and construction from
    the “<em>blind steps</em>” found in some of the ruins at Great Zimbabwe, for
    in this instance the platform must have afforded a good position for
    seeing over the outer wall, and also for watching the entrance which it
    overlooks.</p>

  <p>A similar structure is to be found on the east side of these ruins.
    This also is an excellent piece of workmanship. The steps in this
    instance lead from the west side of the base of the wall to its summit,
    and were once covered with granite cement, portions of which still
    remain. The wall is 8 ft. high, and its north end is beautifully
    rounded. It is 4 ft. 6 in. wide at its base, and 3 ft. wide on the
    summit. The north or rounded end of the wall, at 6 ft. above the
    ground, turns on each side towards the centre of the summit, forming a
    small round tower 2 ft. high. There are four steps, but it is possible
    that other steps were in between each of the steps now seen. The summit
    of the steps faces due east. This wall is not an outer wall.</p>

  <p>There appear to have been at least ten enclosures. There are eleven
    divisional entrances, all rounded, of which eight have portcullis
    grooves and several have rounded buttresses on the inside. Two long
    granite beams and some sections of broken beams were found in most of
    the entrances, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span> not in those in which the portcullis grooves had
    been carefully built up.</p>

  <p>In the northern enclosures and 2 ft. under the surface were found
    several large and massive cement steps laid on curved lines.</p>

  <div class="center">MIDDLE SECTION OF “THE VALLEY OF RUINS”</div>

  <h3>RENDERS RUINS</h3>

  <p>These are the best-defined ruins of the Middle Section of the Valley of
    Ruins, are of better construction, and have walls still standing of a
    fairly good height. All the other ruins in this section are almost, if
    not quite, impossible to trace, and a view of them gives the impression
    that they are of much later construction than the Renders Ruins.</p>

  <p>These ruins, which lie east and west, cover an area of 300 ft. from
    east to west, and 200 ft. from north to south. They lie within 30
    yds. of the south and south-west sides of Posselt Ruins, A and B, the
    intervening space, being full of outcrops of walls. On the south and
    south-west sides of these ruins is the Upper Section of the Valley of
    Ruins.</p>

  <p>The most striking features of the Renders Ruins are (1) their
    complicated plan; (2) the banquette wall on the summit of the south
    wall of No. 3 Enclosure; and (3) the great amount of ancient gold,
    Arabian pottery and glass, and other relics discovered in No. 1
    Enclosure.</p>

  <p>The ruins are built upon the formation rock which slopes down from
    south-west to north-east, the floors of all the enclosures being the
    bed-rock itself, and this has such a steep gradient that at some points
    it makes it difficult for those wearing nailed boots to ascend from the
    lower to the higher portions of the ruins.</p>

  <p>These ruins are approached from the Mauch Ruins by a passage and steps,
    also from the Motelekwe wagon-track, and by a path passing the west end
    of Posselt Ruins B. The North-East Passage leading from the Elliptical
    Temple is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span> scarcely any longer an approach, as the passage walls have
    in some places fallen inwards and blocked the passage.</p>

  <p><i>No. 1 Enclosure.</i>—This is the most easterly of the enclosures of
    these ruins. It is oval in plan, being 73 ft. from east to west, and
    52 ft. from north to south. The walls are substantially built, but are
    constructed in the style usually found in ruins built at some distance
    from any of the main ruins. The highest walls are on the west and
    southern sides, and these average from 7 ft. to 9 ft. in height, 4 ft.
    to 5 ft. at 5 ft. above the floor in width, and are 4 ft. wide at the
    summit. The other walls are considerably dilapidated and average about
    4 ft. in height. The bare formation rock forms its floor, and it slopes
    considerably from south to north.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow600" id="i_387">
    <img src="images/i_387.jpg" width="600" height="360" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Sketch Plan<br />RENDERS’ RUINS<br />Valley of Ruins<br />Middle Section</div>
  </div>

  <p>On the rock floor the following “finds” were made: Twenty pieces of
    beaten gold and gold wire, a few gold beads, amounting altogether
    to 3 ozs. In the yellowish soil above the floor and at a depth of 4
    ft. Arabian glass with arabesque patterns most delicately engraved,
    beautifully glazed pottery of white clay with different bevels on the
    edges, and sunken designs under the glazes which are both sea-green
    and a delicate shade of forget-me-not blue, also very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span> thin china of
    white clay with rich deep blue-and-gold enamel, also some minutely thin
    green glass, a large soapstone bowl, a fine copper chain, and some
    other pottery of excellent make and covered with green glaze, which has
    the appearance of being ancient or certainly of being of very antique
    character. On the upper level was found half a hundred-weight of
    twisted iron wire in coils ready to be cut off in lengths for bangles.
    The coils were fused together. Coils of fine brass wire similarly
    fused, over 200 ivory and glass beads unrecognisable by local natives,
    two pairs of double iron gongs, brass bangles, large cakes of copper,
    crucibles used for smelting copper, and two hundred-weight of hoes,
    axes, and chisels far superior in make to those of the Makalanga of
    to-day. The local natives examined this last class of “finds” with much
    wonderment. There was a total absence of articles of modern native make.</p>

  <p>There is overwhelming evidence that during the last two periods of
    occupations of this enclosure it was most extensively occupied as a
    copper and iron-smelting place.</p>

  <p>On the outer side of the south wall is a remarkable instance of the
    silting of the soil from higher ground. The depth of soil on the south
    face of the wall is at least 5 ft., and this has been washed into its
    present position by the rainstorms of many years. The triangular space
    formed by the wall and the sloping granite rock was thus filled in for
    a length of fully 70 ft.</p>

  <p>There are no signs of any entrances into this enclosure except on the
    north-east side, where there is a long gap in the wall.</p>

  <p><i>No. 2 Enclosure.</i>—This is situated due west of No. 1 Enclosure. Its
    area, which is square save on the south side where it slightly rounds
    outwards, is 30 ft. by 20 ft. The débris from the high east wall of No.
    3 Enclosure has almost filled it up to the summit of its walls. Nothing
    of any antiquarian value was found here, but the examination work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span> was
    only partial. This enclosure probably acted as a passage-way from the
    North-East Passage to Nos. 1 and 5 Enclosures, and possibly towards the
    Lower Section of “The Valley of Ruins.”</p>

  <p><i>No. 3 Enclosure.</i>—The plan of this enclosure, which lies directly west
    of No. 2 Enclosure, is almost circular save that its north-east wall is
    slightly squared. The area is 39 ft. from north to south, and 36 ft.
    from east to west. The walls are exceedingly massive, some being 7 ft.
    wide at base and 5 ft. wide on the present summit at 7 ft. from the
    ground. They are obviously of better construction than any of the other
    walls of these ruins.</p>

  <p>On the summit of the south wall are the remains of a banquette wall
    still 4 ft. long and 4 ft. high, which makes the total height of the
    wall at this point 11 ft. There is only one entrance, which is on the
    north-west, is rounded, and has portcullis grooves.</p>

  <p>This enclosure has not as yet yielded any article of an antique
    character, but modern native articles are practically absent.</p>

  <p><i>No. 4 Enclosure.</i>—This is practically an open space separating these
    ruins on the south side from the ruins which are on higher ground,
    and extend up to the north-east walls of the Elliptical Temple. In
    area it is 150 ft. long from east to west, and averages in width from
    north to south some 50 ft. It is bounded on the south by three long
    semi-circular terraced walls, each about 8 ft. in height. Its floor on
    the north side is of formation rock, which slopes at a steep gradient
    to the north side where soil has silted in to a depth of 5 ft. On the
    north-east side it is bounded by the outer faces of Enclosures Nos. 1,
    2, and 3.</p>

  <p>The North-East Passage runs into the south-west corner of the area,
    and there are steps and a passage leading down from Mauch Ruins at the
    south-east corner of the area.</p>

  <p>In this enclosure were found some fine pottery with Arabic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span> lettering
    on the rim with beautiful designs, also a few gold beads.</p>

  <p><i>No. 5 Enclosure.</i>—This area is 86 ft. from north to south, and 40 ft.
    from east to west. It is bounded by No. 8 Enclosure on the west, by
    No. 2 Enclosure on the south, and by No. 1 Enclosure and a large open
    space not yet explored on the east and north sides. The walls are still
    fairly high, averaging 9 ft. on the south side, 8 ft. on the west, 7
    ft. on the north and east sides. The construction is massive, the walls
    averaging 5 ft. to 6 ft. in width at base.</p>

  <p>The entrance on the north-east side is rounded and had portcullis
    grooves. The foundations of the wall, as in all the older buildings,
    form the floor of the passage.</p>

  <p>The only other entrance is in the south-east corner, and this leads
    into No. 2 Enclosure.</p>

  <p><i>No. 6 Enclosure.</i>—This enclosed area is directly on the west side of
    No. 3 Enclosure, and is 90 ft. from east to west, and averages 35 ft.
    from north to south. Possibly it contained sub-divisions, for small
    walls and traces of walls are to be found within it. The average height
    of the walls, so far as they are intact, is from 6 ft. to 8 ft. The
    floor of this enclosure is formed of granite rock which slopes slightly
    to the north. The eastern end of the south wall runs up a steep rock
    incline sideways, and is in consequence much dilapidated.</p>

  <p>The North-East Passage runs from No. 4 Enclosure into this area at
    its south-east corner where it divides, one part going down into “The
    Valley,” while the other, following along the higher ground, trends to
    the west as far as No. 1 Ruins.</p>

  <p>The two entrances at the south-east corner of the enclosure where
    the North-East Passage divides are both rounded—the entrance on the
    north-east side is also rounded.</p>

  <p><i>No. 7 Enclosure and Passage.</i>—This enclosure, which is triangular in
    form, is the most westerly of all the clearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span> defined areas of the
    Renders Ruins. It is 28 ft. long on its western side, 18 ft. on its
    north-east side, and 29 ft. on its southern side. The inner faces of
    the walls average 8 ft. in height. A large entrance, evidently of some
    importance, is on the west side. This is rounded and has portcullis
    grooves, while the side walls are 5 ft. high and the passage is 3 ft. 6
    in. wide. Steps led from the entrance downwards on the outward side.</p>

  <p>A drain runs through the south wall leading from No. 6 Enclosure.</p>

  <p>A passage 31 ft. long with side walls 6 ft. high leads from this
    enclosure into No. 8.</p>

  <p><i>No. 8 Enclosure</i> appears to be of a very chaotic and irregular
    character, mounds of soil, piles of stones, and traces of
    sub-divisional walls being the principal features of this area, the
    surface measurements of which are 150 ft. from east to west, and 70 ft.
    from north to south. Soil has been evidently brought into the enclosure
    for the purpose of forming platforms on which are the remains of very
    old Makalanga clay huts.</p>

  <p>Probably there were at least six sub-divisions of this enclosure. On
    the north, north-west, west, and south-west the walls average 6 ft.
    to 9 ft. in height, and about 4 ft. on the other sides. The walls are
    substantial and are fairly well built in places, the more substantial
    building being on the west side, where there is a prominent end of an
    angular wall 15 ft. high facing the north.</p>

  <p>There are at least four entrances to this enclosure, viz. one on the
    north side which is rounded, a second on the south side which is also
    rounded and has portcullis grooves, one on the north-east side which is
    angular, and the fourth on the east side, and this is rounded.</p>

  <div class="center">UPPER SECTION OF “THE VALLEY OF RUINS”</div>

  <h3>MAUCH RUINS</h3>

  <p>These are well-defined ruins, and they form part of the Upper Section
    of “The Valley of Ruins,” and are situated on the north-east of the
    north-east extremity of the chevron pattern on the Elliptical Temple at
    a distance of 105 yds. They occupy the granite plateau on the edge of
    steep ground overlooking the Middle and Lower Sections of “The Valley
    of Ruins.”</p>

  <p>The plan and the excellently constructed portions of some of the walls,
    and the class of relics found here in 1903, when these ruins were
    partially cleared out, all point to the building having a distinct
    claim to some antiquity, although of a more subsequent age than that of
    some of the main ruins.</p>

  <p>The distinctive features of this ruin are its high walls, a passage
    running parallel with the inside of the main north-east wall, a large
    semi-circular buttress or platform, and the quantity of beaten gold and
    gold wire discovered here.</p>

  <p><i>Main walls.</i>—The workmanship of some of the lengths of main walls
    is excellent, but some are of inferior construction, portions being
    obviously reconstructions with the joints plainly visible. There are at
    least two reconstructed walls—one on the west side of the main wall,
    and the other on the north-east side of the Parallel Passage. In the
    inferior portions blocks of all sizes and shapes have been employed.
    The best-built portions are the north-east main wall and the divisional
    wall which runs north-east to south-west. All the main walls are built
    upon a curved plan.</p>

  <p>The main walls are still high, though evidently somewhat reduced from
    their original heights. The heights from the outside surface average
    from 9 ft. to 12 ft., and in places the level of the summits is very
    fairly maintained. From the interior surface the heights vary from 7
    ft. to 10 ft.</p>

  <p>The widths of the walls are evenly maintained throughout,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span> being about
    4 ft. 6 in. wide at 4 ft. above the ground, and 3 ft. to 3 ft. 6 in.
    at a summit of 12 ft., the battering-back being about 1 ft. in 8 ft.
    Some of the walls have been thrown out of batter, and the upper edges
    overhang.</p>

  <p>All the ends of the walls are rounded, except in the large divisional
    wall, where is an unfinished end facing north, which terminates
    abruptly.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_393">
    <img src="images/i_393.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Sketch Plan MAUCH RUINS “Valley of Ruins” (<em>Upper Section</em>)</div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Interior Area.</i>—The measurements of the interior are: 98 ft. from
    east to west, and 83 ft. from north to south. The area is of a rough
    oval shape. It originally contained at least three enclosures. The
    soil filling-in is artificial. The elevation of the ruin precludes any
    suggestion of silting in naturally. This work is believed to be that of
    all local natives of some few generations past.</p>

  <p><i>Parallel Passage.</i>—This is 99 ft. long down its centre, and was most
    probably much longer, as its extremities disappear in débris. The
    north-east side wall of the passage, which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span> the main wall, is from
    7 ft. to 9 ft. high at the eastern end, and there is a break owing to
    dilapidations at 50 ft. west of this point, while near the lower or
    western end the walls on either side are 7 ft. high. The north-west end
    is formed by a wall 7 ft. high, a low wall, a semi-circular wall, and
    boulders. On the south side, and opposite the opening in the north-east
    wall, steps to a somewhat higher level can be traced, leading
    southwards up from the passage, and these steps have a rounded wall on
    each side. The rounded end of the north-east main wall is a fine piece
    of workmanship. The passage is from 3 ft. to 4 ft. wide.</p>

  <p><i>Entrances.</i>—There are five entrances, and each is rounded, and all
    the buttresses are also rounded. One entrance leads into the ruin on
    the west side, and there are rounded buttresses on either side, which
    are erected on a semi-circular platform projecting 16 ft. into the
    interior. This entrance opens into a passage which was discovered by
    Bent (1891), but was not opened out till 1903. A second entrance is in
    the north-east wall, but on its western side only traces of the side
    wall remain. A third entrance is on the east side of the building. This
    is 6 ft. high on either side, and is without buttresses or portcullis
    grooves. The floor of the passage is formed by the foundation walls.
    This entrance leads into an outer enclosure on the eastern side. The
    last entrance is between the south end of the large divisional wall
    and the semi-circular buttress or platform. Possibly a buttress has
    disappeared from the south side of this entrance.</p>

  <p><i>Divisional walls.</i>—There are two divisional walls, one being the wall
    already mentioned as separating the two main enclosures. This runs
    north-east from the large semi-circular buttress for 16 ft. It is 9
    ft. high and is well built, and has a drain passing through the lower
    courses. The north-eastern extremity of this wall is 32 ft. from the
    inside face of the main north-east wall. The other wall is 15 ft. long,
    and runs out eastwards from the inside face of the main west wall.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
    This is 7 ft. high, but its height is reduced to 3 ft. at its eastern
    extremity. It is 3 ft. wide at the surface level.</p>

  <p><i>Drain-holes.</i>—There are three well-constructed drains running through
    walls; one passes the divisional wall which is on the eastern side
    of the building, another passes through the main eastern wall into
    the outer enclosure, and the third is in the east wall of the outer
    enclosure.</p>

  <p><i>Semi-circular Buttress.</i>—This structure lies on the south side of
    the ruins, and projects 16 ft. into the interior. The total length
    round the face is 32 ft. It is 24 ft. across the back, and 10 ft. high
    on the west, 6 ft. high on the north, and 6 ft. high on the east. It
    appears to be perfectly solid, and once to have had a level surface.
    Large trees have grown on its south and west sides, and have done
    considerable damage to it. Two small walls are on its north-east side,
    and these run towards the buttress as if they once had formed the
    approach to the summit.</p>

  <p><i>Outer Enclosure.</i>—On the eastern side is an enclosure, but somewhat
    roughly built. It is 51 ft. from north to south, and 30 ft. from east
    to west at its southern end, and 19 ft. from east to west at its
    northern end. This enclosure has been extensively filled in with soil
    and the usual Kafir débris, among which were found two pairs of double
    iron gongs.</p>

  <p><i>West Passage.</i>—This passage, which was discovered by Bent in 1891,
    runs along the outer side of the main west wall for 60 ft. It is 3
    ft. to 4 ft. wide, and the wall on the west side of it is very much
    dilapidated. From the western entrance to these ruins the passage runs
    27 ft. further north, and descends some 29 ft. by means of stairs, and
    then passes out between high walls on to the granite floor of <em>Renders
    Ruins</em>, which are in the Middle Section of “The Valley of Ruins.”</p>

  <p><i>General.</i>—The position of the Mauch Ruins on their east and north-east
    sides is strengthened for defensive purposes by a steep drop of about
    12 ft. down on to the level occupied by the Middle Section of “The
    Valley of Ruins.” This drop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span> is formed by an almost vertical granite
    glacis, which it would have been very difficult to climb.</p>

  <p><i>Finds.</i>—Gold wire, beaten gold, and gold beads, and portions of
    sea-green glazed pottery of white clay.</p>

  <h3>SOUTH-EAST RUINS</h3>

  <p>These ruins are situated at the south-eastern extremity of the Zimbabwe
    Ruins’ area where the Valley of Ruins terminates on its eastern side,
    and are only ten minutes’ walk from Havilah Camp. They occupy a summit
    of a bare and rounded kopje, commanding most extensive views of the
    country beyond Schlichter Gorge to the south and of the Arowi district
    towards the east-north-east. Its position is highly strategetic, and
    there is a steep descent on the south-west side into a deep gorge, down
    which the stream rising on the east side of the Elliptical Temple flows
    toward the Mapudzi.</p>

  <p>The area of well-defined walls is 140 ft. from north to south, and
    120 ft. from east to west, but there are traces of walls in all
    directions—on the south at 70 yds. and on the south-west at 20 yds.
    distance. The formation rock crops to the present surface at many
    places, and the depth of soil elsewhere is inconsiderable.</p>

  <p>The style of building very closely resembles that of Ridge Ruins, which
    lie between the Elliptical Temple and Havilah Camp, as to which there
    are considerable doubts of its being of very remote antiquity.</p>

  <p>The walls, the majority of which are of massive proportions, are not at
    all well built, blocks of all sizes and shapes having been employed,
    and there is little or no attempt to adhere to courses. The present
    reduced average height of the walls is from 4 ft. to about 6 ft., but,
    judging from wall débris, every wall must have originally been at least
    some 7 ft. or 8 ft. in height. The walls are from 4 ft. to 5 ft. wide
    at base, and 3 ft. to 4 ft. wide at their very much reduced summits.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span></p>

  <p>The plan of the building is laid on curved lines, and the only entrance
    which remains intact has rounded sides. It is possible these buildings
    once had six outer and inner entrances. The main entrance appears to
    have been on the west side.</p>

    <img src="images/i_397.jpg" width="600" height="389" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">SOUTH-EAST RUINS<br />Zimbabwe</div>
  </div>

  <p>There are about eight enclosures, and in some of these there are
    remains of very old Makalanga huts, and the soil of the interior is
    filled with great quantities of Kafir pottery, iron-work, iron slag,
    cattle bones, and ashes. Two Kafir graves were found, but these were
    not of any great age. Local natives state their own people once lived
    here, but not in their time, and this is extremely probable; but they
    do not think the walls were built by any Makalanga.</p>

  <p>On the east side, just outside the main wall, there are three sets of
    <i>isafuba</i> game-holes cut into the formation rock. Each set has four
    rows of eight holes each.</p>

  <p>The ruins have been but partially examined at several points, but
    nothing of any antique character has been found here.</p>

  <h3>NO. 1 RUINS</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap">THESE ruins, which are of an important character, lie on the north side
    of the Elliptical Temple at a distance of 63 yds. from the north-west
    entrance to that building, with which it is connected by a substantial
    and well-constructed wall running out due north from the north-west
    outer face of the main wall of the temple at 43 ft. west from the
    north-west entrance and at the points [705 ft.] and [710 ft.].</p>

  <p>Visitors would know this ruin as the one which lies back on the
    left-hand side of the path leading from Havilah Camp to the west
    entrance of the Elliptical Temple, and as the one with the tall
    column-like forms of the aloes crowned with fleshy leaves which line
    the summit of its walls, as also do the candelabra-shaped branches
    of numerous large euphorbia trees which together impart to these
    walls a pre-Raphaelite appearance peculiarly striking because of
    its old-world-looking character. But though this ruin may be known
    to visitors, they rarely examine its enclosures, for the internal
    portions, owing to extensive excavations during past years, are most
    uneven, and require some climbing over their irregular surfaces.</p>

  <p>Whether the age of this ruin synchronises with that of the Elliptical
    Temple is for several obvious reasons open to some question, but that
    it is “ancient” admits of no possible doubt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span> Its architecture and
    construction are both inferior to those of the Elliptical Temple, and
    to many ruins throughout the country which belong to the earliest type
    of Zimbabwe buildings, though it must be admitted that great care is
    shown in its construction. Possibly these buildings are of somewhat
    later date than the Elliptical Temple, while the purpose to which
    it was devoted was such as not to warrant such elaborate care being
    lavished upon it as on the temples and the buildings used as residences.</p>

  <p>Excavators have literally turned this ruin inside out, and have
    excavated whole areas to depths of 5 ft. to 7 ft. till the granite
    formation was reached, and have left some of the foundations both bare
    and undermined. There is no doubt that the building has thus been
    completely ransacked, and yet there is nothing to show that it was
    either a temple or a place where at any time gold-smelting was carried
    on, there being no traces of gold furnaces, blow-pipes, crucibles,
    scorifiers, or cement spattered with gold; in fact, pannings of such
    soil as still remains within it has not so far shown any “traces”
    or fragments of gold wire or beads and pellets of gold such as are
    so frequently and abundantly found in other ruins at Zimbabwe. Nor
    have any indications of copper-smelting been found here as in other
    ruins. There is no suggestion in its plan that it was a temple.
    Certainly there is no decorative pattern on its walls, nor are there
    any monoliths, nor even fragments of what might have been monoliths.
    Certainly stones said to be phalli have been found there, but a few
    years ago it was the fashion in Rhodesia to style every stone of
    peculiar shape a phallus. But supposing some of these objects were
    undoubted phalli, these might easily have come from the Elliptical
    Temple a few yards away, especially seeing that the north-west entrance
    to the temple was enclosed on either hand by walls of No. 1 Ruins,
    and that phalli and miniature soapstone birds have been discovered
    by almost all explorers of these ruins among the débris deposited
    outside all three entrances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span> to the temple. The inner banquette walls
    on either side of the north-west entrance to these ruins, as well as
    the massively built outer walls, strongly suggest a fortification,
    and the conglomeration of tall buttresses overlooking the Elliptical
    Temple, and also “The Valley of Ruins,” rather confirms this view,
    especially as the ruins contain no evidences of any industry having
    been carried on by the ancients within them. Moreover, these are
    the only ruins of any importance on the north and west sides of the
    Elliptical Temple which could possibly have served as a fort for the
    protection of that side of the temple, and its site occupies a strongly
    strategetic position on the summit of sloping ground. Unless it was
    a fortification, the whole flank of the area of small ruins in the
    vicinity of the north entrance would have been undefended, for on the
    northern and eastern sides of such area of ruins are very substantially
    built forts occupying elevations of vantage.</p>

  <p>Sir John Willoughby states that the design of this building is very
    irregular, the inner walls terminate abruptly and form only three sides
    of an enclosure with floors ever varying in their relative levels, the
    wall foundations are of unequal depths, and the interiors of some of
    the walls are carelessly filled in with stones, this latter being a
    feature absent in the earliest types of Zimbabwes, but present in later
    ruins.</p>

  <p>All these departures from the style of construction as employed in
    the Elliptical Temple, and in very many of the ruins at Zimbabwe, are
    obvious to anyone on making an inspection, as also the irregularity in
    the sizes of the stones of any single course, the poorer quality of
    the granite, the employment of unhewn stones, and the introduction of
    the angular and plumb style of building so peculiarly absent in the
    Elliptical Temple and elsewhere at Zimbabwe. There are no drain-holes
    in any of the walls of these ruins.</p>

  <p>Of old and recent Makalanga occupations of these ruins there is
    ample evidence. Kafir pottery, bones, ashes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span> scraps of iron are
    abundant, and the clay foundations of Makalanga huts and granaries can
    be seen in every enclosure on floors overlying rudely filled-in areas.</p>

  <p>These ruins occupy an area of 62 yds. from east to west, and 54 yds.
    from north to south. The portion of the ruins in the best condition, as
    well as the most important parts, are situated on the west side. The
    north and east portions are the most dilapidated. The building on the
    north and north-east sides is on the edge of a sharp slope down into a
    valley which contains the walls of several minor ruins.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_401">
    <img src="images/i_401.jpg" width="400" height="573" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">N<sup>o</sup>. 1 RUINS<br />Zimbabwe</div>
  </div>

  <p>The main or outer wall of these ruins runs for 185 ft. from the west
    entrance on the west side of the building round in a curve outwards
    towards the west-north-west, north, and north-east. There are three
    short gaps in the northern portion of the wall. On the whole, the
    greater portion of the wall is still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span> in a fairly good condition,
    it being from 12 ft. to 15 ft. high above the outside level of the
    bed-rock on which its foundations are laid. The wall is practically
    plumb as compared with the main wall of the Elliptical Temple, besides
    being angular at the entrances. It is 4 ft. wide at 6 ft. above the
    outside level, but the north-western side is slightly wider. The wall,
    though substantially constructed, does not show great evenness of
    courses, while the sizes of the blocks vary considerably. Near the west
    entrance it is very poorly built, while the wall on the opposite side
    of the passage is excellently constructed. Possibly this indifferently
    built portion was repaired at a much later date. It is on this wall
    that grew the tall aloes and large euphorbia trees, some of which have
    recently been removed. The north and north-east portions of the wall,
    being built upon the edge of the declivity, tend to give the wall
    a more imposing appearance, while its elevated position commands a
    splendid view of “The Valley of Ruins.” The large mound on the north
    side of the north-west entrance is soil débris brought by explorers
    from the interior of the ruins in 1892.</p>

  <p>Three entrances pass through this wall, on the west, north-west, and
    north sides.</p>

  <p>The west entrance is 2 ft. 6 in. to 3 ft. wide, the west side wall
    being 4 ft. to 5 ft. high, and the east side 5 ft. to 7 ft. high. The
    entrance walls are plumb and angular. There are no buttresses on either
    side, and no portcullis groves. The entrance leads into Enclosure A,
    but there are traces of a wall which runs across the inside at a short
    distance, and might have been that of a sort of vestibule to Enclosure
    A. Immediately on the outside of this entrance there is a passage
    between the outer face of the main wall on the east side and the east
    wall of Enclosures W X Y Z on the west side, and this passage, which is
    46 ft. long, 3 ft. 6 in. wide and has the west side wall 5 ft. high,
    actually forms part of the entrance. At 31 ft. from the north end of
    the passage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span> there is one side of a rounded entrance into Enclosure Y.
    There are no traces of steps having been built here.</p>

  <p>The north-west entrance was evidently the main entrance. It is the
    largest and best-constructed of all these entrances. It has a banquette
    wall on either hand in the interior, also a strongly built vestibule
    with entrances into Enclosures C and D, and opposite the entrance on
    the outside are walls of other ruins.</p>

  <p>It is 3 ft. 6 in. wide, 7 ft. long, and the walls on either side are
    only 6 ft. high, but they rise sharply to the level of the general line
    of summit of the wall. Three feet of the length of the entrance on the
    east side are formed by the end of the banquette wall, but on the west
    side the banquette wall is only about 16 in. wide. The entrance is
    angular and plumb and has portcullis grooves. This is the only instance
    so far discovered where a completely angular entrance has portcullis
    grooves, also the only instance where the main or, indeed, any outer
    entrance has such grooves, except the north entrance to this ruin,
    which is partly angular and partly rounded. There is no indication that
    this entrance was once covered in.</p>

  <p>Immediately on the inside of this entrance is a small enclosure which
    served as a vestibule and as an approach to enclosures C and D. This is
    9 ft. long, 6 ft. wide, and the walls are from 5 ft. to 8 ft. above the
    paved floor which was destroyed some years ago. At the west end there
    is a passage 4 ft. 4 in. long and 2 ft. 10 in. wide with angular sides
    leading into Enclosure C, the walls on either side being 4 ft. to 5 ft.
    high. At the east end of this vestibule is a passage 9 ft. long and 2
    ft. 10 in. wide leading to Enclosure D, the walls on either side being
    5 ft. to 7 ft. high.</p>

  <p>The north entrance opens into Enclosure D at its north-east corner. It
    is angular on the outside but rounded on the inside. It is 2 ft. 10
    in. wide, 4 ft. 6 in. long, and the walls on either side are now only
    from 3 ft. to 5 ft. high. There are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span> portcullis grooves in the rounded
    portions of the side walls. The entrance does not pass through the wall
    at right angles, but obliquely towards the north, which the opening
    faces. A wall runs north for 15 ft. from the east outer side of the
    entrance, but its extremity terminates in block débris. In the angle
    of the two walls at the outer foot of the entrance are traces of steps
    leading for a few feet down the declivity along the west side of the
    projecting wall.</p>

  <p>The banquette wall rounds round the inside face of the main wall
    on either side of the north-east or main entrance, and forms a
    terrace behind it which would afford a good view over the main wall.
    Practically the main wall and the banquette wall are one and the same
    structure at certain points, since the stones of the main wall project
    into the banquette; but at other points they are independent of each
    other, and at these points the space between the two structures is
    filled in with stones to the level of the summit of the banquette.</p>

  <p>The eastern length of banquette starts from the east side of the
    north-west entrance and runs along the inside of the main wall into
    Enclosure D for a length of 17 ft., the summit being 6 ft. high
    and 3 ft. 6 in. wide at the entrance and 5 ft. wide at its eastern
    extremity. This length of banquette cannot be described as of excellent
    workmanship.</p>

  <p>The western length of banquette is 48 ft. long and 4 ft. to 8 ft.
    high, and is 1 ft. wide at the north-west entrance, but widens out to
    11 ft. at the west end, where it connects with the “conglomeration of
    buttresses,” all rounded, which overlook every part of this ruin. The
    workmanship in this length of banquette is somewhat inferior.</p>

  <p>There are at least ten enclosures, and these, for the purposes of this
    description, are lettered from A to H or named. On the west side there
    are four outer enclosures, and these are lettered W to Z.</p>

  <p><i>Enclosure A.</i>—The area of this enclosure is 105 ft. from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span> north to
    south, its longest points, and 51 ft. from east to west, its widest
    points. It has four entrances.</p>

  <p>The north-west entrance is the west entrance to these ruins, and has
    already been described.</p>

  <p>The south-west entrance is approached by an outer passage on this
    side, but the actual entrance, owing to the amount of débris, can only
    be traced, the débris being level with the summits of the walls on
    either side. These walls are from 4 ft. to 5 ft. high, 3 ft. 6 in. on
    their present summits, and are fairly well built. The passage walls
    are 8 ft. apart for a length of 64 ft. from this enclosure towards the
    south-west, at which point they curve off in different directions,
    the west side wall running a further 51 ft. towards the west, with
    traces of continuation. The east side wall curves round towards the
    south-south-east for 105 ft., including gaps, and at its extremity
    it becomes lost in débris, but in all probability, judging by recent
    clearing away of débris and also by excavations, it ran up to the west
    outer face of the Elliptical Temple. There are no signs of any entrance
    passing through these side walls. The workmanship of both walls is
    fairly good.</p>

  <p>The north-east entrance is from Enclosure E, which lies on the
    north-east side. This was a wide entrance with rounded sides, and
    appears to have been built at a higher level than the floor of
    Enclosure A, but the entrance and the steps leading up to it are now
    almost lost in débris.</p>

  <p>The east entrance is from Enclosure B. This was rounded, but is now
    filled in to the top by wall débris.</p>

  <p>The floor of this enclosure is formed by bed-rock. The highest parts of
    the walls are as follows: south side, 4 ft.; east side, 7 ft.; north
    side, 14 ft.; and west side, 5 ft. to 8 ft.</p>

  <p><i>Enclosure B.</i>—The area of this enclosure, which lies at the south-east
    side of Enclosure A, is 49 ft. from north to south and 23 ft. from east
    to west. This enclosure has two entrances, the one on the west side
    being the east entrance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span> to Enclosure A, while the one on the north
    side is from a passage which connects this enclosure with Enclosure F.
    Both entrances are rounded. This enclosure appears to have been cleared
    out to below the levels of the bottom of the foundations.</p>

  <p>The passage connecting Enclosures B and F runs from south-west to
    north-east. Including the two entrances, it is 23 ft. long, and 3 ft.
    wide at the south-west end, and 5 ft. wide at the north-east end. The
    side walls, which are very substantial, are still 8 ft. high. The
    entrance from this passage into Enclosure F is formed by two large
    rounded buttresses with portcullis grooves.</p>

  <p><i>Enclosure C.</i>—This enclosure is on the west side of the ruins, and
    is on the south side of the main and north-west entrance to these
    ruins, and north of Enclosure A, and is on the inner side of the west
    portion of the main wall. Its length from north to south is 43 ft.,
    and its width from east to west 17 ft. The western length of banquette
    wall forms its west side, and the face of this wall is poorly built.
    The south wall must be considered as badly built. On its south and
    south-east sides is the “conglomeration of buttresses,” the character
    of which can better be seen by glancing at the accompanying plan. The
    buttresses are almost circular, and have their centres filled with
    stones, thrown in most promiscuously. The east wall is well built;
    still it is inferior to any of the main walls of the Elliptical Temple.
    Through this wall is an aperture 2 ft. wide and with side walls 3 ft.
    high. The floor of this enclosure has been cleared away in places,
    showing the foundations of the walls.</p>

  <p><i>Enclosure D.</i>—This enclosure is on the inner side of the north portion
    of the main wall, and east of the north-west entrance to these ruins
    and of the Entrance Enclosure.</p>

  <p>The area of this enclosure is 41 ft. from north to south, and 45 ft.
    from east to west. It is bounded on the north, west, and south sides by
    the banquette and main walls for 23 ft.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span> on the west by the Entrance
    Enclosure for 5 ft., and by Enclosure EE for 18 ft., on the south by
    a wall dividing it from Enclosure E for 10 ft., but the rest of the
    southern boundary wall for 12 ft. is now only débris, and in places can
    barely be traced. On the east side is a wall 15 ft. long, 4 ft. high, 2
    ft. 10 in. wide on present summit, which separates this enclosure from
    Enclosure H; the rest of the eastern boundary is lost in débris.</p>

  <p>From the north inner side of the main wall at 20 ft. from the
    north-west corner of this enclosure there is a wall 4 ft. high
    projecting southwards into the enclosure for 5 ft., and this has an
    angular end.</p>

  <p>A wall 6 ft. long, forming part of the passage from the north-west
    entrance, projects into this enclosure. Judging by the arrangement of
    débris in the space between this wall and the main wall, it is very
    probable that there were steps here leading up to the summit of the
    banquette wall.</p>

  <p>At the eastern corner of this enclosure is the north entrance to these
    ruins. This has already been described.</p>

  <p><i>Enclosure EE.</i>—This enclosure is bounded on the north by Enclosure
    D, on the north-west by Entrance Enclosure, on the west by Enclosure
    C, and on the south by Enclosure E. Its area is 26 ft. from north to
    south, and 27 ft. from east to west.</p>

  <p>The floor of the south-west corner was once at a higher level than that
    of the rest of the enclosure, and to this originally raised portion
    there are remains of a narrow-rounded entrance on the south side, now
    filled up with débris, from Enclosure E. There are traces of steps up
    to this raised entrance. The floor of the aperture in the wall on the
    east side of Enclosure C appears to have been on the level of this
    raised floor.</p>

  <p><i>Enclosure E.</i>—This lies directly to the south of Enclosure EE. Its
    area is 49 ft. from north to south, and 48 ft. from east to west. It
    is bounded on the west for 49 ft. by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span> a wall and the “conglomeration
    of buttresses” already mentioned, which respectively separates it from
    Enclosures A and C; on the south for 45 ft. by Enclosures B and the
    passage which connects Enclosures B and F; on the east for 36 ft. by
    a wall and a large rounded buttress, which is one of the prominent
    features of these ruins; the rest of the east boundary cannot be
    traced, owing to débris piles; lastly, on the north by Enclosures EE
    and D.</p>

  <p>There are still two entrances remaining—one from Enclosure A and the
    other from Enclosure C. Both are approached from the enclosure by
    steps, now ruined but traceable, leading up either side of the central
    buttress of the “conglomeration of buttresses.”</p>

  <p>The large buttress on the east side is semi-circular, the centre of
    its face is towards the west. It is 6 ft. high, 30 ft. round its face,
    and is fairly well built, it being a wall with its internal portion
    promiscuously thrown in till its summit was levelled throughout.</p>

  <p>On the south-west are two rounded buttresses with their faces towards
    the east and west respectively.</p>

  <p>The enclosure contains piles of excavators’ soil débris of some age.</p>

  <p><i>Enclosure F.</i>—This is situated on the east side of Enclosure E, and
    lies between that enclosure and Enclosure G. Its area is roughly
    circular, it being 37 ft. from north to south, and 42 ft. from east to
    west. Its southern boundary is formed for 37 ft. by the outer south
    wall of these ruins, which wall is 5 ft. high and 4 ft. wide on its
    present very reduced summit. There is a gap of 12 ft. on its north-west
    side, where there are now only traces of a wall.</p>

  <p>The enclosure has two entrances now remaining—the entrance from the
    passage leading from Enclosure B, which has already been described,
    and an entrance through the outer south wall. This entrance which
    is rounded is 2 ft. 6 in. wide, the side walls are 3 ft. high, and
    there are portcullis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span> grooves on either hand, and these have been
    deliberately built up. This enclosure resembles the other portions of
    these ruins with regard to large piles of soil débris on its area.</p>

  <p><i>Enclosure G.</i>—This is the most easterly enclosure in these ruins. It
    is bounded on the south by Enclosure F, on the west by Enclosure H,
    and on the north and east by the outer east wall of the ruins, which
    wall is 8 ft. high and 3 ft. 6 in. wide on its present summit. Its
    area is 35 ft. from east to west, and 47 ft. from north to south. It
    possessed three entrances, and these were on its west, north, and east
    sides. The west entrance is barely distinguishable, but has traces of
    its having been angular. The north entrance has rounded sides, and
    leads from Enclosure H, a wall 22 ft. long and 5 ft. high forming a
    division between the two enclosures. The enclosure has been filled in
    with débris up to the level of this wall and overlooks the east end of
    Enclosure H, which here is very much lower. The east entrance through
    the outer wall is rounded on its south side, but the north side has
    disappeared.</p>

  <p><i>Enclosure H.</i>—This lies on the inner side of the north and north-east
    portions of the main wall, which here is considerably broken. It is
    bounded on the west by Enclosure D, on the south by Enclosures E and
    F, and on the east by Enclosure G. Most probably there was an entrance
    between the main wall on the east side and Enclosure G, and this led
    to the network of ruins which are built up against this side of No. 1
    Ruins and extend for some 300 yds. towards the east. The area of this
    enclosure is 53 ft. from east to west, and 31 ft. from north to south.
    The western end of this enclosure is considerably higher than the
    eastern end.</p>

  <p><i>Outer enclosures.</i>—Four enclosures lie to the west of the south-west
    extremity of the main wall, and are separated from it by the passage
    which leads to the west entrance of these ruins, and connects these
    enclosures with Enclosure A.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span></p>

  <p>These enclosures adjoin one another in a single line broadways from
    south to north, there being a common wall for all of them on their west
    sides. These enclosures are lettered W to Z, commencing at the south
    end.</p>

  <p>Their areas are as follows:—</p>

  <div class="ml10">
    W 25 ft. N. to S., and 20 ft. E. to W.<br />
    X 15 ft.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 〃&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;26 ft.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 〃<br />

  <h3>RIDGE RUINS</h3>

  <p>These ruins are situated on the highest point of the bare granite ridge
    which extends from the north-west of the <em>Elliptical Temple</em> towards
    the north-west, and curves towards the north, where it terminates at
    <em>Havilah Camp</em>.</p>

  <p>The southern extremity of these ruins is 140 yds. from the north-west
    side of the <em>Elliptical Temple</em> and 100 yds. west of <em>No. 1 Ruins</em>. The
    path from the outspan and camp to the water springs and the <em>Elliptical
    Temple</em> passes close to its west side, while another path to the
    <em>Temple</em> passes close to its east side. The <em>Outer Defence Wall</em>,
    which runs from the west side of the <em>Temple</em> round towards the west,
    north-west, and north of the <em>Acropolis Hill</em>, runs parallel to the
    west side of these ruins at a distance of 96 ft. A number of euphorbia
    trees and aloes line its walls, which are now comparatively low, the
    highest parts being about 9 ft.</p>

  <p>The whale-back granite glacis on which these ruins are built dips
    sharply from immediately outside the walls all round these ruins,
    except at the south-east end, which is here only slightly higher than
    the present ground level outside the <em>Elliptical Temple</em>. Except for
    vegetable mould at a few points, the whole of the floors of these ruins
    are formed by the formation rock.</p>

  <p>The plan of these ruins shows an oval area, with a long and wide outer
    passage running along its east side for 246 ft.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span> from the north to the
    south of the oval enclosure, this passage having its southern extremity
    well protected by traverses and buttressed entrances.</p>

  <p>These ruins, though built of irregularly sized stones, have the faces
    of the walls which still remain remarkably true and even, so much so
    that experienced builders after examining the walls state that with
    such irregularly sized stones it would be most difficult to erect
    walls with faces as true as those of these ruins. There appears to
    be no similarity whatever between the second-period architecture and
    construction and these ruins, except that the filling-in of the walls
    between their faces is more promiscuous than is the case with walls
    of first-period architecture and construction. Its entrances and
    buttresses are all rounded, and the walls have a fair batter-back,
    there being no plumb wall present.</p>

    <img src="images/i_411.jpg" width="600" height="443" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Sketch Plan<br />RIDGE RUINS<br />Zimbabwe.</div>
  </div>

  <p>It would be difficult to state the purpose these ruins were intended to
    serve, but seeing they occupy the most westerly position of the main
    ruins’ area, and that they are built on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span> commanding and strategetic
    position, it might be inferred, if their claim to any great antiquity
    were established, that their purpose was that of a fort, defending
    not only the westerly side of the main ruins’ area, but also part of
    a main line of communication, of which the Parallel Passage formed
    a section, between the <em>Elliptical Temple</em> and the west end of the
    <em>Acropolis Hill</em>. This suggestion is, in fact, apparently supported by
    the numerous traverses in the passage, traces of which can still be
    noticed, and by the fact that the oval enclosure overlooks the passage
    throughout its length. But, as stated before, these ruins cannot at
    present be classed as <em>ancient</em>, though they are undoubtedly of great
    age.</p>

  <p><i>Oval Enclosure.</i>—The area of the oval enclosure is 170 ft. from north
    to south, and 86 ft. from east to west. These are its longest and its
    widest points. The floor is formed by comparatively level surfaces of
    granite rock. There is very little soil within the enclosure, and this
    consists of black mould, decomposed cement, and native clay. The walls
    still standing average some 4 ft. to 7 ft. in height, and are about 3
    ft. 6 in. wide on their present reduced summits, and are battered-back.
    Plumb and angular walls are absent. The east wall is at one point
    carried over a large boulder 8 ft. high, and a few courses of blocks on
    the summit still remain. The north wall is considerably dilapidated,
    and the débris of this portion lies on the face of the declivity.
    The external faces of the walls are in a much better condition than
    the inner faces, for trees and shrubs which could not grow on the
    outer granite slopes manage to thrive in the very scanty soil of the
    interior. This enclosure has been used by the natives as a cattle
    kraal. Though cattle could not climb into the enclosure from outside,
    they no doubt damaged the inside faces of the walls by attempting to
    get outside from over the walls. The material for the stone foundations
    of circular huts of no very great age, which are to be seen in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span> the
    enclosure, was very probably taken from the inside faces of the walls.</p>

  <p>These Makalanga stone foundations, which are identical with those found
    in old Makalanga kraals, occupy the following positions. At 60 ft.
    from the south end and 12 ft. from the west side, foundations of stone
    blocks 19 ft. in diameter. At 110 ft. from south end and almost facing
    the west entrance, stone foundations of hut 22 ft. in diameter. At 8
    ft. from north end foundation blocks disarranged and exact measurement
    impossible. At 60 ft. from south end and 10 ft. from east side is
    another foundation, but here again the blocks have become considerably
    disturbed.</p>

  <p>This enclosure has two entrances, and these are on the south and west
    sides respectively. The south entrance is comparatively intact, but the
    west entrance is buried in wall débris and can only be traced on one
    side. Both are rounded. The south entrance walls are 3 ft. 6 in. high,
    the passage is 2 ft. wide and 7 ft. long, and there are portcullis
    grooves. The north side of the west entrance is formed by a large
    boulder 6 ft. high.</p>

  <p>There is no trace of ornamentation on the walls, but if it ever
    existed, the walls having become so reduced, it must have disappeared.
    No article was found for which the slightest antiquity could be
    claimed, all the finds being obviously of native make, though somewhat
    superior to their make of to-day.</p>

  <p><i>Parallel Passage.</i>—Roughly speaking, the passage throughout its length
    of 246 ft. from north to south runs parallel with the east wall of
    the oval enclosure and follows it round in its curves, but narrowing
    towards its southern extremity. There is no entrance from the passage
    to the oval enclosure except at the south end. At the north end the
    passage is 47 ft. wide, and the formation rock forms the floor; at
    40 ft. further south the passage is 36 ft. wide; at 80 ft. from the
    north end 22 ft. wide; at 160 ft., 19 ft. wide; at 190 ft., 13 ft.
    wide, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span> width is maintained as far as the southern extremity. The
    heights of the outer wall vary from 5 ft. to 7 ft., the best-preserved
    lengths being near the southern end, where a pair of traverses with
    rounded ends stand at a few feet north of the south entrance to the
    passage. This entrance has rounded sides.</p>

  <p>A passage crosses from east to west at the southern extremity, and in
    it are three entrances with rounded sides. Opposite the south face
    of the southern extremity of the passage, and at 6 ft. distance is
    an independent screen wall, 16 ft. long and 5 ft. high, covering the
    approach to the entrance from the south. At several points in the
    parallel passage there are distinct traces of traverses.</p>

  <p>The new path from <em>Havilah Camp</em> to the <em>Elliptical Temple</em> now runs
    through the parallel passage of these ruins.</p>

  <h3>CAMP RUINS NO. 1</h3>

  <p>Camp Ruins Nos. 1 and 2 lie north and south respectively of the
    Shangani Grave, which separates them, the huts of the camp being built
    on the north and wrest sides and within a few feet of the remains of
    Camp Ruins No. 1, which is Sir John Willoughby’s No. 3 Ruins in his
    <cite>Further Excavations at Zimbabye</cite>, 1892.</p>

  <p>Sir John describes this ruin as follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Previous to my arrival, the only trace of ruins here was one
      small stone buttress on the eastern side. My original intention
      was to find any wall foundations that might exist, and then to
      cross-cut right through the mound at their level from east to
      west, and from north to south. But I was deterred from carrying
      this out, because as the work proceeded, traces of cement
      floors at different levels were discovered. By starting low
      down the mound, I came upon a wall, varying in height from 4
      ft. to 6 ft., which encircled it. The original height of this
      wall can only be estimated by comparing the existing structure
      with the fallen débris which was buried by an accumulation of
      soil. At the foot of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span> wall, and on the outside, I found
      many specimens of arrow-heads, Kafir pottery, bracelets, and
      necklaces of iron and copper. I also found something which may
      perhaps prove to be an object of special interest. This was a
      piece of copper about 6 in. in length and a quarter of an inch
      thick, covered with a green substance (whether enamel, paint,
      or lacquer, I am unable to determine), and inlaid with one of
      the triangular Zimbabwe designs. It was buried 5 ft. below
      the surface, almost in contact with the east side of the wall
      itself.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“I also discovered a small cave under a big rock that
      culminates in the highest point of the mound, but the only
      object of interest here found, besides bits of coarse pottery,
      was a piece of crystal or glass. On driving into the mound
      through a somewhat broken entrance in the inside wall of the
      west side, I was much puzzled by striking a level cement floor
      some 4 ft. above the wall foundations, and on following this
      level I came upon a second floor about 2 ft. above the first.
      It would therefore seem that originally there were a series of
      cement terraces, one above the other, culminating in a point
      of observation on the south side on the summit of a large
      rock, or that different occupants at varying dates had made
      new floors. It was near this rock that I came upon one of the
      few pieces of masonry inside the other wall,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span> and that only
      very fragmentary in character. In following the outside wall
      on its inner face, I found it varied in width between 2 ft. 6
      in. and 4 ft., and that its foundations also varied much in
      depth. In the cutting thus made I came upon three small furnace
      holes close together on a level with the top of the wall as it
      now stands, the foundations of which increased in depth as I
      proceeded, and disclosed here and there what appeared to be an
      extensive layer of ashes with the bones and teeth of animals. A
      notable peculiarity in this mound is the variety of stratified
      soil with folding concave towards the centre. The surface soil
      is more or less black; then comes a bright red clay divided by
      a broad yellow streak, and below this a dash of yellow, with
      here and there a vein of decomposed sandstone or other rocky
      substance. During this excavation I was not very successful in
      finds, which were only represented by three pieces of sea-green
      china, one of which was lying in the solid red clay below the
      surface, and 8 ft. to 10 ft. into the side of the mound, and
      two dull green porcelain beads, found 7 ft. deep and near its
      centre. Taking into consideration the ash beds and furnace
      holes already referred to, I feel justified in suggesting that
      once a workshop was here the scene of useful activity, and
      at that time surrounded by an irregular wall for protective
      purposes, with a point of outlook to guard against surprise,
      such as the big rock with the summit would represent.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As the author resided actually within Camp Ruins for fully two years
    (1902–4), very frequent opportunities of thoroughly examining the walls
    have presented themselves, the result being that it is now ascertained
    that these ruins as seen to-day can be shown to be not ancient but of
    a some very old Makalanga period. The furnace holes alluded to have
    been used for iron-smelting, and to the depth of 11 ft. no single
    article approaching an antique or even mediæval character has been
    found within or near its walls. The brass wire bangles found at depth
    still have their grass, hair, or fibre intact. Garden hoes, assegai
    heads, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span> coarse pottery of ordinary Kafir make are here found in
    abundance. The green pottery beads are found in almost every ruin at
    Zimbabwe, and never at lower depth than the yellow soil which lies
    immediately under the black vegetable mould on the floors of all the
    ruins. Certainly, the present natives do not know this class of beads.
    That this building, as suggested by Sir John Willoughby, was once a
    workshop is obvious from the quantities of iron slag and ashes and
    burnt clay floors and iron furnaces found in the vicinity. The bones
    of animals are mainly those of buck of all kinds. The construction of
    the walls precludes any suggestion that they could have been standing
    very many centuries, certainly not extending back to any period which
    could, even by long inference, be considered “ancient.” The workmanship
    is decidedly poorer than that shown in modern Kafir buildings in the
    district.</p>

  <p>But while this ruin, as seen to-day, may not itself be ancient, there
    is some evidence that the ancients must have fortified this knoll;
    and when we consider its strategetic position on the granite ridge,
    extending from the south-west foot of the Acropolis Hill and the
    Elliptical Temple, it becomes highly probable that later people have
    utilised the material of some older buildings once occupying this
    position in the erection of their poorer structures. Foundations of
    walls surround the knoll at distances of some fifty and one hundred
    yards from these ruins, and these show a fair claim to be recognised as
    ancient, or, at any rate, as older than the walls on the summit. The
    “cement” mentioned by Sir John is common soil <i>daga</i> (clay), similar to
    that found in old Makalanga huts and floors.</p>

  <p>The ruin crowning the knoll is roughly circular, with a diameter of
    about 100 ft., with walls varying in height from 4 ft. to 6 ft. The
    accompanying plan, with explanatory notes, kindly lent to the author
    by Sir John Willoughby, shows the character of this ruin. The “finds”
    made here in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span> 1902–3 are identical with those discovered by Sir John
    Willoughby.</p>

  <h3>CAMP RUIN NO. 2</h3>

  <p>This ruin lies 50 ft. south of Camp Ruins No. 1, and is on the same
    knoll, the two being separated from each other by the Shangani
    graveyard.</p>

      Zimbabwe</div>
  </div>

  <p>Sir John Willoughby writes:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“I carefully attacked Ruin No. 2, but with a disappointing result. It
      merely appears to be an enclosure formed by an irregular outside wall,
      varying in thickness and in the depth of its foundations. In tracing
      this wall, the bed-rock was occasionally exposed at a depth of 3 ft.
      The only ‘finds’ here were two small pieces of sea-green china, one
      small piece of white china, a few Kafir arrow-heads, whorls of poor
      make, two fragments of pottery having a kind of basket design, and a
      copper or brass clasp or fastening, which probably formed part of a box
      of modern date.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This ruin has recently been re-examined with similarly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span> disappointing
    result, and the remarks made with regard to No. 1 Ruin apply equally
    to this ruin. Clay foundations and floors of old Kafir huts fill the
    interior at different levels. Probably in the most ancient period, long
    before the present structures were erected, one large ruin occupied the
    site of both Nos. 1 and 2 Ruins, and encircled and crowned the knoll,
    for judging from very old foundations, walls surrounded the knoll. At
    least there were two such walls, one being within and higher than the
    other.</p>

      <span class="small">RUINS NEAR ZIMBABWE</span>
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="subheadc">East Ruins—Other Ruins within the Zimbabwe Ruins’ Area.</div>

  <h3>EAST RUINS</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap">THESE ruins lie 20 yds. to the south of the Motelekwe Road at 550 yds.
    east of Havilah Camp, and face the east end of the Acropolis Hill at a
    distance of 300 yds. south.</p>

  <p>They occupy a rise overlooking the Valley of Ruins, and are built
    upon an open granite glacis which originally formed its floor. Their
    elevated and strategetic position at once claim the attention of
    visitors. These ruins have always been written and spoken of as being
    a fort for the defence of the east side of the Valley of Ruins, and,
    in fact, for all the ruins of the lower Zimbabwe group, including the
    Elliptical Temple, and especially for the eastern end of the South-East
    Ancient Ascent to the Acropolis. Judging from the contour of the
    country round about, the only possible line the ancient road from the
    east and the coast could have taken must have passed within a few yards
    of this ruin.</p>

  <p>The view from East Ruins towards the east is most extensive and
    picturesque, for the land slopes on that side for over two miles
    towards the Beroma Range and the valley of the Motelekwe, while in the
    hollow are the Chipo-popo and Mapudzi rivers. Opposite are the peculiar
    and romantic columns of granite near Chenga’s kraal.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of defence these ruins are ideally situated. On the
    south side they are protected by a steep declivity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span> some 40 ft. into
    the valley, and down this the original builders and later occupiers
    have shot their débris in great quantities. The space between the ruin
    and the declivity, some 25 yds. in width and 100 ft. in length, is
    covered with short lengths of walls and wall débris.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_421">
    <img src="images/i_421.jpg" width="500" height="568" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Sketch Plan<br />
      EAST RUINS<br />Motelekwe Road<br />Great Zimbabwe</div>
  </div>

  <p>The area covered by these ruins is 140 ft. from north to south, and 93
    ft. from east to west. It is most probable that on the south and east
    sides there were other enclosures.</p>

  <p>The walls on the north, west, and south are fairly well built and
    massive, and are still some 8 ft. to 10 ft. in height, and average 3
    ft. 6 in. to 4 ft. width of summit at those heights. The walls on the
    south-east and east average a height of from 4 ft. to 7 ft., while the
    divisional walls which remain have a reduced height of 4 ft. and 5 ft.,
    and these latter are also substantially constructed.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span></p>

  <p>There are four well-defined enclosures, the two on the west side being
    the most perfect. The northern enclosure had once been subdivided into
    at least six separate compartments.</p>

  <p>Both in plan and construction these ruins excel most of the minor
    ruins, including No. 1 Ruins, and many walls on the Acropolis. The
    curved lines of the walls on the northern and southern sides are bold
    and striking, and well and exactly carried out. Their solidity is very
    noticeable, especially on both outer and inner faces. Not only are the
    courses in these walls fairly even, but the blocks are well-sized and
    are of a good quality of granite. In some portions of the walls the
    workmanship is of an inferior character.</p>

  <p>But, whatever the style of construction may be, the faces of the walls
    are beautifully even from base to summit and also lengthways, for
    placing one’s eye close up against the wall and glancing along an area
    of wall-face, there is hardly to be seen half an inch of front of block
    protruding in front of its neighbours. This, of course, does not apply
    to the batter-back, which is only that of an average wall at Zimbabwe.
    The impression gained on viewing these massive walls, which occupy such
    an excellently strategetic position, is that the original builders
    intended the building to be used for some important purpose.</p>

  <p>The northern enclosure is 60 ft. from north to south, and 67 ft.
    from east to west. The south-west enclosure is 61 ft. from north to
    south, and 51 ft. from east to west. The eastern enclosure is 55 ft.
    from north to south, and 22 ft. from east to west. The south-eastern
    enclosure, which is rather rudely constructed, and the walls of which
    are very considerably dilapidated, is 20 ft. from north to south, and
    80 ft. from east to west.</p>

  <p>There are three entrances through the outer walls, and these are on the
    west, south, and east, and all are rounded; two have buttresses, one
    has portcullis grooves, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span> foundation forms the passage floor in
    each case. Two divisional entrances now only remain, and these are also
    rounded.</p>

  <p>Immediately inside the west entrance and on the north side is what
    appears to have been a raised platform, facing west, about 4 ft. above
    the original floor. This may have an area of 15 ft. from north to
    south by 12 ft. from east to west, but the artificial filling-in of
    the ruin with soil has raised the interior surface to the level of
    this platform. Probably, as at other ruins at Zimbabwe with identical
    platforms in corresponding positions, this afforded a look-out
    overlooking the entrance. On the eastern side of these ruins there is a
    similar but smaller structure which may have answered the same purpose.</p>

  <p>In the eastern enclosure and on the east face of the west wall is a
    recess starting upwards from the ground. This is 3 ft. high, 1 ft. 10
    in. wide, and the blocks on each side respectively are flush-edged with
    each other. The recess goes back about the length of two blocks (see
    <cite>Architecture</cite>—<cite>Blind Recesses</cite>).</p>

  <p>These ruins have been artificially filled in with soil to a depth of 3
    ft. to 5 ft. by native occupiers of a comparatively late date, for the
    soil on the surface and downwards to the bottom of the filling-in is
    thick with old native pottery and the broken-up remains of Kafir huts.</p>

  <p>Although almost every relic-hunter seems to have paid attention
    to these ruins, nothing of any antique value has been found here.
    Probably when the original occupiers left the granite floors were
    still exposed, and any objects found there may have been removed long
    before the filling-in took place. So far, there is no evidence that any
    industry—whether of ancient, mediæval, or modern occupiers—has ever
    been carried on in this building.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span></p>

  <h3>OTHER RUINS WITHIN THE ZIMBABWE RUINS’ AREA</h3>

  <p><i>Bentberg (Matusu).</i>—This kopje, which is 240 ft. above the threshold
    of the West Entrance to the Elliptical Temple, lies immediately south
    and south-west of the temple. Only 200 yds. separate the building from
    the foot of the hill. Here are many signs of very old occupations in
    the form of ruined terrace walls apparently of the Zimbabwe style, but
    of a very late period. The local Makalanga state that though their
    predecessors of the same race have had kraals on this hill, the terrace
    walls are not of any Makalanga construction; and this appears to be
    obvious. Further, though Makalanga pottery is abundant, yet there
    can be found both pottery and cement of a very superior quality and
    make; and such are repudiated by the natives as having been made by
    Amangwa, Makalanga, or Barotse. Great quantities of quartz broken into
    very small splinters are to be found in large areas on the hill. The
    nearest quartz reefs are six miles west of Zimbabwe. The older remains
    of terraces—many buried in silted soil—are to be found on the north
    side of the hill, but traces of walls can be met with extending almost
    to the summit and round the western flank. It is impossible to imagine
    that the ancients did not in some manner occupy the hill, as otherwise
    the Elliptical Temple would have been exposed on its south side without
    any defences. The old Barotse had a kraal at the foot of the north side
    of the hill just above the spot where are still the traces of Bent’s
    camp.</p>

  <p><i>Rusivanga Kopje.</i>—This hill (190 ft.) rises from the Zimbabwe Valley
    at some 300 yds. west of Havilah Camp. It is directly on the right of
    the road from Victoria to Zimbabwe at about a third of a mile from
    the main ruins, the road passing between it and Makuma Kopje on which
    is Mogabe’s kraal. The northern and eastern faces of this hill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span> show
    in places from base to summit abundant evidence of occupations by
    ancients and also by very old Makalanga and Barotse. The remains of
    walls are in most instances of inferior construction, though at some
    points the courses of excellently built wall can be traced. There are
    also rudely built ramparts and enclosure walls of some later period. On
    the summit of the hill was once a fort. Fragments of soapstone, slate,
    quartz, and ironstone are to be found, also large stone-crushers, some
    excellent pottery, and cement work of superior quality. At one point
    is a cement wall carried across the top of a boulder. There are stone
    foundations of Makalanga huts which are circular and lined with cement,
    and winnowing floors with raised edges. On the eastern side of the
    hill two sets of <i>isafuba</i> game-holes have been cut into the surface
    of the granite rock. Each of these has thirty-six holes. On the west
    side and near the summit there are at least thirty different sets of
    game-holes cut into the granite, the holes of the sets varying in size.
    On the open granite areas on the hill are several places where deep
    depressions have been worn into the rock, evidently by the sharpening
    of tools or by grinding stones.</p>

  <p><i>Ruin on Bingura’s Path.</i>—This is located on the left-hand side of the
    path leading to Bingura’s kraal at about half a mile from the camp.
    Only its south-east wall is now standing, but its outlines can be
    traced by piles of blocks on all other sides. The area covered is about
    half an acre. The wall is well and substantially built, and is still 6
    ft. high. This appears to be of very old construction. There have been
    no important “finds” made here, the ruin not having yet been examined.
    It occupies a strategetic position on slightly raised ground in the
    valley between the Bentberg and Rusivanga.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span></p>

  <h3>RUIN NEAR CHENGA’S KRAAL</h3>

  <p>This is situated one mile and a quarter east of Havilah Camp, and is
    the most easterly ruin of the Zimbabwe group. It stands upon a low
    ledge on the west side of the Beroma Range, and is a quarter of a mile
    west of Chenga’s kraal, and directly overlooks the Mapudzi stream,
    which flows at about 60 ft. immediately below the west face of the
    ruin. The position is strategetic and affords a view over several
    valleys. The area covered by walls and stone débris is fully an acre
    and a half, but the actual walls now standing in any recognisable form
    of plan only cover 100 ft. by 80 ft.</p>

  <p>A cluster of large boulders has been utilised, and over these and
    between them the walls have been erected, the interior being filled
    up with earth almost up to the summits of the walls by some later
    occupiers. On clearing this foreign soil from the interior faces
    of the walls, two buried entrances, both rounded, were discovered,
    and it was then possible to prepare a plan of such of the walls as
    were so cleared. Nothing of any antique value was found during these
    operations, all the “finds,” which were not numerous, being of old
    native articles.</p>

  <p>All the walls are curved, and all buttresses, entrances, and ends of
    walls are rounded, and have a distinct batter-back. The granite blocks
    in some portions of the walls are as regular in size and shape as those
    to be seen in the Elliptical Temple, but the construction is not of
    the best. The outer faces of the walls have been first raised, and the
    internal portions afterwards filled in with stones of all sizes and
    shapes, but larger than those seen in the filling-in of the interiors
    of many of the walls at Khami Ruins. The courses at some points are
    very regular, but at others there has been no attempt at making any
    courses. The column style of building adopted by old Makalanga and
    Barotse is present in parts. The walls average about 4 ft. in width at
    base and 3 ft.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span> on present reduced summit. There is no mural decorative
    work introduced.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_427">
    <img src="images/i_427.jpg" width="400" height="497" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Sketch Plan<br />
      RUIN near CHENGA’S KRAAL<br />
      (Zimbabwe)</div>
  </div>

  <p>The natives state that this ruin was not built by the same people that
    built the rough walls of the minor ruins at Zimbabwe, their theory
    being that it was erected by Barotse very many generations ago, and
    on this point they are very emphatic. The translations of the native
    expressions for relics are “pretty stone” and “money.” In starting work
    here, the labourers, who receive small rewards for discovering relics,
    grumbled considerably, and informed the author that it was useless to
    work there, as no “pretty stones” or “money” would be found there.
    Similar remarks were made about other small ruins, and in every case
    they have been proved to be correct. Whether this ruin has actually any
    claim to antiquity is a matter which, at present, it would be unsafe to
    dogmatise upon.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span></p>

  <h3>CHENGA’S AND MADAVID PATH RUINS</h3>

  <p>These ruins are in a valley which runs north and south on the Beroma
    Range at one mile distance south-east of Chenga’s kraal, and lie a few
    yards to the west of the native path leading from Chenga’s to Madavid’s
    kraal. Madavid is the native name for David, a Basuto, who lives near.</p>

  <p>The area covered is fully a third of an acre on the summit of a knoll,
    which rises some 30 ft. above the valley. Traces of walls covering an
    area of an acre and a half are to be seen on the south, west, and north
    sides. Large granite boulders have been utilised in the construction,
    the walls being carried in curved lines from boulder to boulder,
    enclosing a rudely drawn circular area 51 ft. from east to west, and
    42 ft. from north to south. In one instance the wall is carried over a
    boulder.</p>

  <p>The faces of the walls show good workmanship, the courses being fairly
    even, the joints uniformly distributed, and the blocks regular in size.
    The bases of the walls average from 4 ft. to 5 ft. in width, while the
    very reduced summits are 3 ft. 6 in. wide at 5 ft. from the ground. The
    walls display a carefulness in construction which is absent from some
    of the divisional walls of the main ruins at Zimbabwe. The side walls
    of the entrance on the east side of the building are most perfectly
    rounded. There is no mural decoration. The interior of the building is
    of earth, which contains Kafir pottery, etc. No exploration work has
    been done here.</p>

  <h3>MAPAKU, OR “LITTLE ZIMBABWE” RUINS</h3>

  <p>These ruins are situated at a distance of seven miles south-east of
    Zimbabwe, and occupy a position overlooking the Motelekwe Valley,
    and are on the eastern side of the lower shoulders of the southern
    extremity of the Beroma Range. On the south side of the ruins the
    ground falls in the direction of the Motelekwe River, which here flows
    south to south-west of the ruins at the distance of about a mile. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
    Mapaku kraal is a quarter of a mile north-west of the ruins. At the
    village are some caves (<i>I-Baku</i>, cave; <i>Mapaku</i>, caves). The headman
    is a Molinye, younger brother to the Mogabe Handisibishe of Zimbabwe.
    Good water can be obtained from several places in the vicinity of the
    ruins.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_429">
    <img src="images/i_429.jpg" width="600" height="512" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">MAPAKU RUINS<br />or “Little Zimbabwe”</div>
  </div>

  <p>The area covered by these ruins, excepting traces of outlying walls,
    is 70 ft. from north to south, and 80 ft. from east to west. Though
    the ruins are small in area, yet they have a considerable importance,
    seeing that they form one of the ruins of the chain of such structures
    which stretches at certain intervals from Zimbabwe along the Motelekwe
    River, which chain again connects with the chain of a similar class
    of ruins running from the lower Sabi in Portuguese territory in the
    direction of Sofala. The chains of ruins appear to point out the
    ancient approach from the coast to the metro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>politan centre at Zimbabwe
    and the gold districts of Southern Mashonaland and Matabeleland.</p>

  <p>The thickness and height of the walls are the first features which
    will strike anyone on entering the building, especially when the small
    size of the centre ruins are taken into consideration. The walls are
    all built on curved lines, and average a width of 4 to 5 ft. at the
    base, and 3 ft. at present reduced summits at 8 ft. above the ground.
    All the walls are built upon the granite rock formation, and there is
    comparatively very little soil on the floors, and most of this is black
    vegetable mould. Fortunately these ruins have not been subjected to the
    filling-in operations of the very old Kafir peoples as have so very
    many ancient ruins in Rhodesia. The absence of sufficient soil for the
    growth of large trees has no doubt saved the walls from more serious
    dilapidation. The walls are white with lichen, this being a feature in
    all the ruins along the Motelekwe Valley, which, seen from Zimbabwe, is
    usually filled with mist-fogs.</p>

  <p>The main entrance evidently is the one on the south-west side of the
    building, for here is a long narrow passage leading from the interior,
    the passage running parallel to the south main wall forming an easily
    defended approach. The ruins have only two entrances—the main entrance
    and an angular entrance on the north side without portcullis grooves.
    This latter entrance leads into an outer enclosure only, and is
    protected on the inside by what may be described as a “sentry-box.”
    This is a curved wall 7 ft. long and 5 ft. high, enclosing a small area
    large enough to hold two or three men, and its entrance opens on to the
    inside of the entrance in the main wall. There are several of these
    “sentry-boxes” at Zimbabwe occupying exactly similar positions near
    entrances.</p>

  <p>The interior of the building contains at least four enclosures and two
    long passages, and these may be described as follows:—</p>

  <p>No. 1 Enclosure, which is on the north-east side of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>ruins, is
    22 ft. from east to west, and 13 ft. 6 in. from north to south. The
    floor is formation rock covered over (1903) with a few inches’ depth of
    vegetable mould. The main wall, which forms its north and east sides,
    is 6 ft. high throughout, the wall on the west is 8 ft. high, and the
    curved walls which divide this enclosure from No. 2 Enclosure average
    6 ft. and 7 ft. in height, except at the entrance to No. 2 Enclosure,
    where the height on either side is reduced to 5 ft.</p>

    <div class="caption">SLATE BEAM IN RECESS OF ENTRANCE, PHILIPS’ RUINS, VALLEY
      OF RUINS</div>
  </div>

  <p>No. 2 Enclosure, which is roughly circular in form, is only approached
    by one entrance, and this is on its north side, and leads from No. 1
    Enclosure. This entrance is angular, and has portcullis grooves, and is
    2 ft. 8 in. wide and 3 ft. 6 in. long. The walls of this enclosure are
    substantially built, being 3 ft. wide at their summits, which average
    7 ft. to 9 ft. in height. The area enclosed is 20 ft. from north to
    south, and 24 ft. from east to west. This enclosure, judging by its
    complicated approach, was evidently the principal part of the ruins.</p>

  <p>Nos. 1 and 2 Enclosures are only approached by a passage 25 ft. long
    running north and south, which is 2 ft. 10 in. wide at its northern
    end and widens to 6 ft. 6 in. at the south end. The west wall of the
    passage is from 5 ft. to 6 ft. high, and that on the east side 7 ft. to
    8 ft. high.</p>

  <p>Leading from the north end of this passage into No. 1 Enclosure is a
    covered entrance, 5 ft. high, 2 ft. 6 in. wide, and 5 ft. long. The
    roof is supported by flat granite slabs. On either side, and extending
    from floor to roof, are portcullis grooves. This entrance is somewhat
    dilapidated, and it is feared that one side of it may soon fall down.</p>

  <p>No. 3 Enclosure is bounded on the north by the divisional wall of No.
    2 Enclosure, on the east and south by the curved main wall, and on the
    west by a very dilapidated divisional wall, which separates it from
    No. 4 Enclosure. It is 21 ft. 6 in. from north to south at its widest
    point, and about 35 ft. from east to west at its longest point.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span></p>

  <p>This enclosure is the first to be approached from the main or west
    entrance to the building, with which it is connected by a passage
    running parallel to the south main wall for 28 ft. Where the passage
    enters No. 3 Enclosure are the remains of a rounded buttress on the
    north side. From this buttress the passage westwards is 4 ft. 6 in.
    wide, but quickly narrows to 2 ft. 8 in., which width is maintained
    till it reaches the main entrance. The wall on the south side of
    the passage is from 6 ft. to 9 ft. high, and that on the north side
    averages 5 ft., but is greatly dilapidated toward its eastern end.</p>

  <p>No. 4 Enclosure is on the western side of the building, and is 41 ft.
    from north to south at its broadest part, and 39 ft. from east to west
    at its longest part.</p>

  <p>On the south side of the exterior are two circular stone foundations
    of one course each. These are 9 ft. in diameter. A number of granite
    blocks lie to the east of the building, and suggest the former
    existence of some structure.</p>

  <p>The construction as a whole is somewhat similar to that seen in some of
    the buildings in the Valley of Ruins at Zimbabwe. Straight joints and
    tilted blocks, long and shallow in form, and a disregard of courses,
    are the principal features in the workmanship shown in these ruins.
    There is no mural decoration.</p>

  <h3>NOTE B<br /><br />
    ROBERT M. W. SWAN</h3>

  <p>We regret to record the death, which took place on March 26th last,
    of Mr. R. M. W. Swan, well known for his share in the earlier
    investigations of the ruins of Mashonaland. Mr. Swan was born in 1858,
    and after receiving a technical training in Glasgow University and in
    the laboratory of Mr. R. Tattock, went out to Spain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span> in 1878 in the
    capacity of a mining expert. In 1879 he went to Greece, and the next
    seven years were spent in mining work, principally in Antiparos and
    neighbouring islands. In addition to his professional employment, he
    devoted much attention to archæology, publishing several papers on his
    researches, and sending many specimens to the British Museum. It was
    during this period that he first made the acquaintance of Mr. and Mrs.
    Theodore Bent, whom he accompanied during their visits to several of
    the islands, afterwards taking part in the expedition to Mashonaland,
    carried out by them in 1891, for the examination of the Zimbabwe and
    other ruins. During this expedition he undertook the cartographic
    portion of the work, executing for the first time a careful plan of
    the ruins, besides mapping the country along the routes followed,
    and fixing the positions of a number of points astronomically. When,
    after his return to this country, Mr. Bent described the results of
    his journey before the Society, Mr. Swan added some notes on the
    geography and meteorology of Mashonaland, and subsequently contributed
    to the <cite>Proceedings</cite> (May, 1892), a short paper on the orientation
    of the ruins, showing in a striking way the close connection which
    existed between the arrangement of the structures and the astronomical
    phenomena to which, as sun-worshippers, their builders had paid so much
    attention. The subject was more fully discussed in the section which he
    contributed to Mr. Bent’s <cite>Ruined Cities of Mashonaland</cite>. The theory
    which he developed was subjected to some criticism; but on returning
    to South Africa to continue his investigations, he collected <em>data</em>,
    which, as he claimed, fully bore out his ideas. During this journey,
    carried out in 1893, he examined various ruins, till then undescribed,
    besides doing something to improve the mapping of the country along his
    route, which led inland by way of the Limpopo.</p>

  <p>This visit to South Africa lasted about two years, spent in part in
    geological and mining work. In 1896 he examined the mining districts of
    Western Australia and Tasmania, and in 1898 went to Siam with a similar
    object, leaving again, after a short visit to this country, for the
    Malay Peninsula, where he was engaged in mining work until his death,
    which took place at Kuala Lumpur after an operation for abscess of the
    liver. Here, as in South Africa, he did much careful cartographical and
    geological work.</p>

  <p>Mr. Swan was an expert linguist, and from his residence in Greece had
    acquired a great love for the classics. He possessed a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span> store
    of knowledge on varied subjects, which he was always anxious to share
    with others. He was a Fellow of the Geological and Chemical Societies,
    as well as of our own, which he joined in 1893, having received the
    Murchison Grant in 1892. (<cite>Royal Geographical Society’s Journal</cite>, May,
    1904.)</p>

    NOTE ON OLD POTTERY FOUND AT DEPTH AT RENDERS RUINS, GREAT ZIMBABWE, JULY, 1903</h3>

  <p>This “find” consists of pottery of a very good quality about a quarter
    of an inch thick, but covered with a most excellent glaze of blue,
    white, and gold enamel, the white forming the background.</p>

  <p>There are at least four bands of pattern which encircled a large open
    bowl. No. 8 is a part of the rim, which was straight. No. 1 appears by
    its form to have been portion of the upper band; Nos. 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7
    the second band; No. 9 the third band; and a decoration of palm fronds,
    in brown paint and in outline only, its lowest band.</p>

  <p>The clay is a light brown and of fine quality.</p>

  <p>The lettering or pattern is outlined with faint gold, with yellow
    paint scroll-work filling the spaces between, and so minute are these
    decorations that very few would notice them. They resemble, only on a
    very minute scale, No. 3.</p>

  <p>I cannot piece the fragments together, but Nos. 4 and 7 seem to fit.</p>

  <p>The glaze is very thickly laid on, and both inside and outside are
    covered, and it is of such splendid make, colour, and appearance that
    many who have seen it say it is of the highest quality.</p>

  <p>The inside is white, and has lines of faint blue artistically drawn
    without being of any set pattern.</p>

  <p>No portion of the base found would enable one to judge whether the bowl
    had been made on a potter’s wheel or not.</p>

  <p>All the fragments were found together on a deeply buried floor, and at
    the same spot a quantity of large pieces of beaten gold and some gold
    beads were discovered.</p>

  <p>Some very thin light-brown pottery covered with white enamel, extending
    some inches down from the rim inside and with thick bars of dull blue
    enamel running from rim to centre, were also found at the same spot.</p>

  <h3>NOTE D<br /><br />
    ZIMBABWE RUINS</h3>

  <blockquote>
    <p>[Extracted, by permission, from the Reports (1900–1902) of the
      British South Africa Company.]</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I arrived at Victoria on the 23rd May, and left for Zimbabwe the
    following morning.</p>

  <p>On inspecting the ruins I found the interior of the Elliptical Temple
    one impenetrable jungle of trees, bushes, creepers, tall grass (6
    to 10 ft.), and decayed tree stumps and branches, so that it was
    impossible to see beyond a few feet, while the surface of the ground
    was most irregular and thickly covered with wall débris. The air
    inside was fetid and heavy-smelling from the rank vegetation. There
    being no opening on the eastern side, the interior is protected from
    the prevailing winds, and the sun shining on the damp, dense, and
    almost tropical foliage and plant growth made the air oppressive and
    unhealthy, so that one could not remain long at a time in the building.</p>

  <p>Our first work was to clear away the undergrowth, but it was so dense
    and matted with creepers that, with fifteen men working for a whole
    day with hatchets, sickles, and spades, we were only able to advance
    a few feet into the interior from the west entrance. It required nine
    days for fifteen men to clear the interior of undergrowth alone. A
    further three days were given to pulling up grass and shrub roots. The
    atmosphere of the interior is completely changed, as the sun has dried
    the surface of the ground. It is now possible to stand in the centre of
    the building and obtain an uninterrupted view of the walls all round,
    and at the same time to see at a glance the whole of the divisional
    walls and enclosures.</p>

  <p>The north side of the summit of the Conical Tower has in very recent
    years been denuded of several courses of blocks owing to the boughs
    of large trees swinging upon it in the high winds. The tower is more
    reduced than is shown in photographs taken six years ago. The dentelle
    ornamentation on the summit has practically disappeared within the last
    ten years. Some ancient blocks in the top courses are likely to fall.
    These blocks could be pushed back flush with the face of the tower, and
    some of the blocks which have very recently fallen might be restored to
    their original position.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span> The summit when cleared of vegetation should
    be cemented over. It is a feature in Zimbabwe construction everywhere
    in Rhodesia, for a block, when it falls, to carry with it the stones of
    the course beneath it.</p>

  <p>Visitors point out that the tower has lately shown a tendency to tilt
    somewhat towards the north-east. This is mainly due to the dense tree
    growth enveloping the tower, which keeps it constantly dripping with
    moisture, especially on the north side, where the main wall further
    screens it from the morning sun. The only remedy appears to be to
    so thin out the trees that the tower and its foundations may become
    perfectly dry. The wet state of the tower has caused it to become
    overgrown with lichen, which, decaying, produces vegetable matter
    which lodges in the crevices of the courses, and out of which grow
    small plants and shrubs, many of which we have removed. A large bush
    was growing out from the side in mould so formed, and the remains of
    a large bush on the summit are still to be seen. Should the tilting
    not be prevented by such means as the thinning out of adjacent trees,
    the value of the tower to scientists as a means of calculating the
    orientation of the temple, and therefore its age, would become lost.
    Three or four trees from close to the north-east, north, and north-west
    sides of the tower have been cleared away, and the vicinity has already
    a much drier appearance.</p>

  <p>The dank air and soil round the tower have caused the extensive growth
    of large parent monkey-rope trees, which with their ropes spread in
    great lengths in all directions, thickly interlacing the tops of the
    trees, while their roots have in very many places pierced into both
    main and divisional walls and torn out lengths of stonework. Monkey
    ropes appear to be the most active source of the dilapidations of the
    walls near the tower, but wild vines also have done considerable harm.
    Several hundred yards of monkey rope have been cut down and taken
    outside the temple, also very long stretches of monkey rope roots have
    been pulled up. All lower branches are being removed, so as to give a
    clear view all round the temple. Some of the upper branches are being
    thinned out.</p>

  <p>The surface of the ground within the temple is covered with rich
    leaf mould soil to a depth of at least one foot, and sometimes under
    trees to a depth of one foot and a half. It is in this mould that
    the thickets of large shrubs, creepers, especially monkey-ropes and
    wild vines, seem to have thriven, as also in the débris heaps left by
    Mr. Bent (1891) and Sir John Willoughby (1892), where the turning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
    over of the old time-hardened soil has ventilated it and caused most
    sturdy growth of plants and trees. This leaf mould has been removed
    from the floors of the inner parallel passage and in the passage on
    the north-east, east, and south-east sides of No. 1 Enclosure, and
    has been passed through sieves, and the soil neatly piled for future
    examination. Thus has been removed in these places the unhealthy smell
    formerly noticed. This work ought to be done in all internal enclosures
    of the building.</p>

  <p>All wall débris is being neatly stacked and piled near where it
    obviously came from. All scattered stones on the floors are being
    collected and placed in piles. This work has made the enclosures to
    appear neat and tidy. Messrs. Bent and Willoughby’s débris is also
    being stacked in much smaller compass. All débris heaps are being
    marked “débris” on painted boards. A large quantity of such débris
    might after examination be removed outside the building and stacked.</p>

  <p>The summits of the main walls have been damaged at several points
    by past and present boughs overspreading the walls and beating them
    till several courses, the whole width of the walls, have disappeared,
    thus causing depressions in the top line of walls at several points.
    All branches, whether from trees within or without the temple, which
    overhang the walls, are being carefully removed with the aid of
    guide-ropes. Leaf mould has collected on the summits of the main walls
    to such an extent that large shrubs and small trees are thriving on the
    summits; these will be removed.</p>

  <p>Seven monoliths have been found under the leaf mould and grass and
    shrub roots both inside and outside the foot of the main walls. Their
    former positions on the walls are being ascertained, and where obvious
    they will be re-erected.</p>

  <p>The chevron pattern on the outside of the walls of the temple has been
    damaged, and in three places partially destroyed by large swinging
    boughs. It is also destroyed in two places by heavy festoons of
    creepers which had their roots in the open work of the pattern, the
    roots pushing out some of the blocks of which the pattern is composed.
    Some of these fallen blocks have been found, and there is a probability
    that a portion of the pattern, where damaged, may be restored. It is
    proposed to hand-pick all vegetable soil from the open spaces of the
    pattern to prevent future growths of creepers.</p>

  <p>A clearing 8 yds. wide has been made round the outside of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span> whole of
    temple, and an inspection of the walls by visitors is now possible.</p>

  <p>All the tops of divisional and broken portions and ends of walls, and
    all interstices on both faces, are having the leaf mould carefully
    hand-picked from them. This is a slow process, but will check their
    dilapidation by vegetable growth for a very long time.</p>

  <p>The trenches made by Mr. Bent and Sir John Willoughby are being cleared
    of grass and silted soil, and their spade and pick marks on the bottoms
    can be seen. No ancient floor or soil has been disturbed, the ancient
    floors being some 3 ft. to 5 ft. below the present surface.</p>

  <p>Roots of monkey-ropes and trees are binding the inside of main walls
    below the present surface, as does a large plant in a small pot, and
    are in most places, and below the surface, penetrating into the dry
    masonry with damaging effect. I would suggest that a trench 2 ft. wide
    by 3 ft. deep be made on the inside of all walls, and all such roots
    removed. A yearly inspection of such trenches could be made, and any
    new roots and runners lopped off as they appeared. Run-offs could be
    made to prevent any accumulation of water in the trenches.</p>

  <p><i>Architectural features.</i>—(<i>a</i>) Four ancient drains, in addition to
    those mentioned by Bent and Willoughby, have been discovered.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) A rounded entrance with double curves; the only instance so far
    known.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) Three sets of stone steps and several square yards of ancient
    cement flooring (not of the original builders) have been carefully
    uncovered.</p>

  <p>(<i>d</i>) A second-period architecture building with terraces superimposed
    on the walls of a first-period ruin.</p>

  <p>(<i>e</i>) An enlarged plan of the temple, based on Mr. Bent’s and Sir
    John Willoughby’s measurements, is being prepared, and a quantity of
    altogether fresh architectural detail included.</p>

  <p>Though the present is not a treasure-seeking expedition, yet there is
    strong probability that some “finds” of historic value may be made.</p>

  <p>I have visited the Hill Fortress several times. Both the Western and
    Eastern Temples on this hill are so full of undergrowth that it is
    quite impossible to make any examination until it is cleared away.
    Within a week I hope to put on men to make a good path up to the
    fortress.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span></p>

  <p>The following new features in ancient architecture have been
    discovered:—</p>

  <p>1. A dentelle pattern till recently covered with wall débris. A portion
    destroyed by roots (Acropolis Ascent).</p>

  <p>2. A small enclosure with cemented lining on face of walls (Acropolis).</p>

  <p>3. Three wedge-shaped buttresses, first set discovered in Rhodesia
    (Acropolis).</p>

  <p>4. Two drains, one showing signs of having been cemented (Acropolis).</p>

  <p>5. A northern ancient ascent between parallel walls from large rounded
    entrance near donga in the valley.</p>

  <p>6. Passage 7 ft. deep and about 20 ft. long, completely buried in
    fallen wall débris, over which the visitors’ path had crossed (South
    Enclosure, Acropolis).</p>

  <p>7. Passage 8 ft. deep and 30 ft. long, completely covered by wall
    débris, over which the old visitors’ ascent path had crossed (Platform
    Enclosure).</p>

  <p>8. The round towers on the large west wall of Acropolis can now be
    shown, by the radii of stones of the top courses recently discovered,
    to have originally been conical.</p>

  <p>9. Two large ancient entrances, hitherto unknown, deliberately filled

  </blockquote>

  <p><i>Zimbabwe, Acropolis Ruins.</i>—I regret having to report that the
    slanting granite beam on the platform at the Western Temple of the
    Acropolis Ruins has fallen and is fractured. This happened during the
    heavy thunder and rain storms of last week. The discovery of its fall
    was made to-day by Mr. Molyneux (Scientific Association, Bulawayo),
    Mr. Herbert Hayles (Sheriff of Victoria), and myself. No clearing or
    any other operations have been conducted here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span> within a distance of
    twenty feet. Mr. Molyneux thoroughly agrees with me that the fall was
    perfectly natural.</p>

  <p>The beam has for at least twelve years leant over at a severe angle,
    and now it can be seen that it was once perpendicular. The base was
    only fixed in the stonework for 1 ft. 8 in. The length of the beam from
    the base was 12 ft. 11 in., but this was longer by 2 ft. 4 in. some
    time previously to Mr. Theodore Bent’s visit in 1891.</p>

  <p>The great marvel is that no one has been killed by its fall, for many
    visitors climbing to the platform have used the beam to assist in the
    ascent, and also in descending, and I have, as is well known, on scores
    of occasions warned them not to do so.</p>

  <p>The beam in falling did but slight damage to the surrounding masonry.
    The portions of the beam are now laid together.</p>

  <p>I have photographs of the platform, and showing this beam, taken from
    all points of the compass.</p>

        with Dr. A. H. Sayce, who has independently arrived at the same
        conclusion. “There is no gold in Southern Arabia,” he writes, “and
        consequently Ophir must have been an emporium to which the gold was
        brought for transhipment from elsewhere” <i>The Early History of the
        Hebrews</i>, 1897, p. 463).

        Ophir</i>, contributed to the <i>Annales de Géographie</i> for September 15,
        1902: “Ces monuments de l’Afrique du Sud ont <i>une parenté certaine</i>,
        avec les monuments himyarites de l’Arabie méridionale. Les hommes qui
        ont construit les forteresses de la Rhodesia venaient, portés par la
        mousson, de la côte méridionale d’Arabie chercher l’or du Manica et du
        Mashona.”

      <a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> And, it may be asked, in the above-quoted passage from
        1 Kings, does the expression “ships of Tharshish” mean “ships of the
        sea”? The Hebrew text has אֳנִיּוֹת תַּרְשִׁישׁ, “ships of Tharshish.” And if
        for Tharshish we substitute Ophir—Oppert’s alternative suggestion—we
        get nonsense; “ships of Ophir go to Ophir.” Even the “higher critics”
